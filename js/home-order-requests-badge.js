// home-order-requests-badge.js — how many order lists are still waiting, on the
// Orders card of the Home screen.
//
// It exists for the same reason its client-order twin does: the banner inside
// Orders is only seen by somebody who has already opened Orders, and the Home is
// the first screen of the installed app. Without this, a list sent after the
// morning's round is invisible until the next time anybody happens to open that
// page — and the whole risk of this feature is a list that reaches nobody.
//
// The Home is the shared landing screen — the ONE sanctioned place a feature
// signal may surface outside its own folder. It reuses the Orders data layer and
// the SAME pure rule the banner uses, so the two numbers cannot disagree. (The
// client-order badge had to be fixed once for exactly that: it counted by a rule
// of its own and went on nagging after the work was done.)
