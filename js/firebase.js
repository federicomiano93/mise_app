// firebase.js — Firebase setup + Firestore helpers
//
// Real config lives here; firebase.example.js is the placeholder template.
// js/firebase.js IS committed to Git: Firebase web API keys are public config
// (sent to every visitor's browser), not secrets. Security comes from Firestore
// Security Rules + API key restrictions, never from hiding this file.
//
// This module:
//   1. Initializes Firebase
//   2. Owns THE SESSION: who is signed in and which location they are working
//      on, which is what decides where every Firestore path points
//   3. Exports the log / calculator-config helpers
//
// Public API consumed by the rest of the app:
//   - sessionReady / onSession / currentSession  → every data layer and the gate
//   - signIn / sendReset / signOutNow            → js/auth-gate.js, js/home-session.js
//   - switchLocation / chooseLocation        → js/home-session.js, js/auth-gate.js
//   - saveLogToFirestore(record)                 → js/log.js
//   - deleteLogFromFirestore(dough)              → js/log.js
//   - side-effect `import './firebase.js'` for init → js/app.js

// ── Firestore, with the offline cache ON ─────────────────────────────────────
// WHY. Until now the app had no Firestore persistence at all, so a write made
// while the connection was down was held in MEMORY, never resolved, and was gone
// the moment the page reloaded — with nothing said to the person who made it.
// This app is used in a kitchen, on phones, where the signal comes and goes: an
// order typed in a cold room and lost on the next reload is exactly the failure
// nobody finds out about until the delivery does not arrive. With the cache on,
// that write is written to disk, survives a reload, and is sent when the phone
// is back. Reads come from disk too, so the app opens with real data offline.
//
// persistentMultipleTabManager, not the single-tab default: the same phone or
// laptop can have the Calculator open in one tab and Orders in another, and the
// single-tab manager gives the second tab NO cache at all (the first holds the
// lock). Sharing it across tabs is the behaviour that matches how the app is used.
//
// ⚠️ THIS MUST BE THE FIRST TOUCH OF FIRESTORE IN THE WHOLE APP. The SDK settles
// its settings on first use: initializeFirestore() after anything has already
// called getFirestore() throws, and getFirestore() first would create the default
// memory-only instance and silently keep it. The three feature data layers
// (orders/catalogue/pastries firebase-*.js) all `import '../firebase.js'`, and an
// ES module's imports run before its own body, so this line always wins the race.
// tests/firebase-offline-cache.test.mjs pins that, because nothing else would.

// ── Local emulator switch (AUTOMATIC, by hostname) ────────────────────────────
// On localhost / 127.0.0.1 the app talks to the LOCAL Firebase Emulator Suite, so
// development and manual browser testing NEVER touch production Firestore. On any
// other hostname (the live github.io domain) it connects to production as before.
//
// This decision is made automatically from the URL — there is deliberately NO
// manual flag. A flag could be left in the wrong state and either point the live
// site at the emulator or point local testing at production. Hostname can't be
// forgotten: it is simply where the page is being served from.
//
// The production config above is unchanged; we only REDIRECT the SDK's traffic to
// the local emulator ports (firebase.json: auth 9099, firestore 8080) when local.
// ⚠️ EXPORTED, AND EVERY OTHER FIREBASE APP IN THIS REPO MUST USE IT. The client
// ordering page and the link minter each create a SECOND Firebase app (so a client's
// session can never displace a member of staff's), and a second app is NOT covered by
// the connect*Emulator calls below — they attach to this app's instances only. A
// second app that decided for itself, or forgot to decide, would sign people in and
// write documents against PRODUCTION while the page it lives on says "LOCAL EMULATOR
// mode" in the console. That is the exact accident this project's hostname switch
// exists to make impossible, so the answer is asked once, here, and imported.

// only the Firebase console can write.

// ⚠️ ORDER MATTERS. The location id must be set BEFORE any read or write,
// because it is what builds every Firestore path. That is why nothing in the app
// awaits "signed in" any more — it awaits `sessionReady`, which resolves only

// display filter and says so — so this collection grows by a document per dough
// per day, for ever. Unbounded, every single opening of the Calculator re-read
// the entire history: a few hundred documents after one year, a few thousand
// after several, on every phone, several times a day, billed each time.
//
// 30 days is far wider than anything the screen can show: the longest retention
// selectable is 48 hours (LOG_RETENTION_OPTIONS), and even a log made FOR
// tomorrow is counted from the end of that day — a handful of days at the very
// most. The margin is there so the window can never be the thing that hides a
// log, and so raising the retention options later needs no thought here.
//
// A single-field range needs no composite index, so this works with no console
// setup. Documents missing createdAtMs would be excluded — but they are already
// invisible on screen, because filterVisibleLogs reads the same field and treats

// listener. watchRecipes() in js/catalogue/ subscribes to EVERYTHING — right for
// a screen that lists 500 recipes, ruinous for a Calculator that needs three: it
// would turn every app open from 3 reads into 500+, on every phone, for ever
// (P14). The same mistake was made and corrected on the Home's order badge (v207).
//
// ⚠️ AND IT IS THE CALCULATOR'S OWN READ, not an import from the Catalogue's data
// layer. Features must not reach into each other's Firestore code; only a PURE
// model may be shared, which is the precedent Food Cost already set with
// recipe-cost-model.js.
//
// onChange receives { id, ...data } for one recipe, or null when it cannot be

// has been deleted has to make the tab REFUSE, not quietly keep the last copy.
