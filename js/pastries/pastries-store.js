// pastries-store.js — the seven live day lists, bridging Firestore and the UI.
//
// Resilience (P17) + cost (P14): the days are held in memory and mirrored to
// localStorage, so the screen paints instantly and works offline. The listener
// is attached only when this page initialises (via initPastries), never at app
// boot — and it is seven documents, so it stays seven reads for ever.
//
// Writes are per-day and LOCAL-FIRST: memory + cache + UI update immediately
// (instant, offline-friendly), and the Firestore write is best-effort. If it is
// REJECTED (rules, App Check, no network), the optimistic change is ROLLED BACK
// and the failure is surfaced — a row that stays on screen after a failed save
// is worse than no row at all, because it looks like the work is done.
//
// The cache key needs no registration anywhere: js/local-data.js clears every
// key it does not explicitly keep, so this data cannot follow someone from one
// location into another.
