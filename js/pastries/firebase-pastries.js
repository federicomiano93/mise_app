// firebase-pastries.js — Firestore data layer for the Pastries screen.
//
// Reuses the Firebase app and the SESSION established by js/firebase.js (the
// single sanctioned cross-file bridge), so this screen shares the one signed-in
// account, the one open location, and inherits the localhost emulator switch +
// App Check.
//
// Collection: locations/{location}/pastries/{Weekday} — SEVEN documents, for
// ever, one per weekday, with the id being the capitalised English weekday name
// ('Monday'…'Sunday'). That is the same vocabulary the Orders feature already
// stores in supplier orderDays/deliveryDays, and it means this collection never
// grows: one listener, seven reads, no pagination and no cost that creeps up
// over the years (P14). js/location.js is the only place that knows the path.
