//
// Deliberately separate from pastries-store.js. The day lists are read on every
// opening of the screen; the records are read only when someone opens Records,
// so the everyday cost stays at seven documents (P14).
//
// NOT cached in localStorage, unlike the day lists. A record is a historical
// note, not something anyone needs in their hand offline.
//
// ⚠️ NOTHING IN THIS FILE DELETES ANYTHING BY ITSELF. It used to: there was a
// prune here, with its own guards. It was REMOVED — not switched off — because
// nothing may delete from the database on its own. The bin on the Records
// screen is now the only thing in the app that removes a record, and a person
// has to tap it. Deleting a record from the Firebase console still works too;
// that is a human decision as well.
