// anyway, and interrupting someone who opened Orders to record a delivery is
// exactly the wrong moment to explain a new feature.
//
// It lands right after the update flow: the "New version available" banner is
// tapped, the page reloads on the new code, and this file — new in that same
// version — finds a stamp it does not recognise and says what changed.
