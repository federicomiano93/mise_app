// firebase-client-orders.js — the client page's own connection to Firestore.
//
// ⚠️ A SECOND FIREBASE APP, NOT THE DEFAULT ONE, AND THIS IS THE WHOLE REASON THE
// FILE EXISTS. Firebase keeps one signed-in account per app instance. If the client
// page signed in on the default app, then a member of staff who taps a client's link
// out of curiosity — or the owner, testing it on his own phone — would be signed OUT
// of the app and into the customer's account, on their own device, with nothing
// saying why. A named second app has its own session storage, so the two never meet.
//
// ⚠️ IT IMPORTS ../firebase.js FOR THE CONFIGURATION, AND ONLY FOR THAT. A second
// copy of the Firebase settings is the one thing worse than this import: two files
// that could disagree about which project the app talks to. Importing it also happens
// to satisfy the rule that the offline cache is configured before anything asks
// Firestore for an instance (tests/firebase-offline-cache.test.mjs) — an ES module's
// imports run before its body, so js/firebase.js always wins that race.
//
// What that import brings with it is the staff session machinery, which on this page
// finds nobody signed in on the default app and does nothing at all. It cannot grant
// anything either way: the rules decide what an account may touch, not which
// JavaScript happens to be loaded next to it.
