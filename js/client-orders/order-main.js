// order-main.js — the client ordering page, from the link to a sent order.
//
// THE WHOLE FLOW: read the link → sign in → find out which client this is → show that
// client's products → let them type → send. After the first visit the link is not
// needed again, because the session lives on the device: an order must never depend
// on finding an old WhatsApp message.
//
// ⚠️ THE SECRET IS REMOVED FROM THE ADDRESS BAR AS SOON AS IT IS READ. It arrives in
// the fragment (after the #), which browsers never send to a server, so it is not in
// any web-server log — but it would sit in the address bar over the customer's
// shoulder and in their browser history for ever. Stripping it costs one line.

// carrying data-i18n — here, the tab title and the two lines in order.html's markup
// — and re-runs on every setLanguage(). Without it this page's browser tab said
// «Send your order» to an Italian client for the whole session, because nothing on
// this page ever touched document.title.

// client may read and which is rewritten every time the address book is saved.
//
// ⚠️ THE FALLBACK IS DELIBERATELY NAMELESS. A menu published before this change
// carries no bakeryName, and putting a real venue's name here as a default would
