// price-model.js — what an ingredient costs, and how a purchase form becomes a
// rate. PURE: no DOM, no Firestore, so every rule below is asserted in a unit test
// instead of being read back out of rendered markup (P15) — the same reason
// archive.js, reminders.js and day.js exist.
//
// ⚠️ IT LIVES IN js/ ROOT, NOT IN js/orders/, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE. Orders owns
// ingredients and enters their prices; the Recipe catalogue reads those prices to
// cost a recipe. A feature folder must never import from another feature folder
// (CLAUDE.md, "Modular by feature") — that rule is what keeps each feature liftable
// into its own app — so the alternative was a second copy of this maths, kept in
// step by a sentinel test. A copy of a CALCULATION is worse than a copy of a
// dialog: two files that quietly disagree about what a kilo costs produce two
// different food-cost percentages and nothing on screen says which is right.
// So it sits in the shared base instead, beside location.js and sections.js, which
// both features already import for exactly the same reason.
//
// WHY A PRICE LIVES ON THE INGREDIENT. A price is not a property of a thing, it is
// a property of the RELATIONSHIP between a thing and the supplier who sells it —
// and in Orders an ingredient document already IS that relationship (it carries a
// supplierId). So the price belongs here, on the document that already knows who
// it is bought from, and no second address book has to exist.
//
// ⚠️ THE COST THIS PRODUCES IS NOMINAL, NOT ACTUAL. It is the price of the usual
// supplier's article, not of the batch that happened to be in the kitchen that
// morning. A one-off substitution (bought elsewhere because the van did not come)
// is deliberately invisible here. That is a known, accepted limitation: the
// alternative is asking someone to record every substitution, which nobody does.
//
// ── HOW A PRICE IS ENTERED ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
// One number and a unit, never a sentence:
//
//     priceUnit 'kg'  ·  pricePerUnit 7.20   →   £7.20 / kg
//
// The RATE is typed. It used to be derived, from a pack price divided by a pack
// size — two boxes whose only job was one division, and whose second box asked
// again for the pack weight the ingredient already carries in its own `weight`
// field a few lines higher in the same form ("2.27kg"). Two places holding one
// fact drift, and the one nobody updates is the one every recipe cost is built
// from.
//
// ⚠️ SO THE DIVISION MOVED TO THE PERSON, DELIBERATELY. An invoice reading
// "£180 for a 25kg sack" is entered as 7.20, not as 180. One box that always
// means the same thing, instead of two and a rule about which one the invoice
// total goes in. Whoever enters prices has to know that — the form says it on
// the field, which is the only place it can be said, because a number cannot be
// inspected for what it is a price OF.
//
// ⚠️ PRICES ARE NET OF VAT. The business reclaims input VAT, so what an
// ingredient really costs is the ex-VAT figure. Entering the gross one inflates
// every recipe cost and every food-cost percentage by the VAT rate, and nothing
// on any screen would look wrong. Same class of silent error, same remedy: it is
// written on the label.
//
// `packPrice` and `packSize` are RETIRED rather than renamed — see PRICE_FIELDS.
// `pricePerUnit` already held exactly this rate, so every price entered before
// the change opens showing the right number and nothing had to be migrated.

import { t } from './i18n.js';
// ⚠️⚠️ THE CURRENCY IS NO LONGER A CONSTANT IN THIS FILE, AND THAT IS THE POINT.
// It used to be `export const CURRENCY = '£'`, written when every venue was in the
// UK — and it printed pounds on an Italian bakery whose ten prices were typed in
// euros. It now follows the venue's COUNTRY (js/market.js currencyOf), and the
// session sets it when a location opens.
//
// ⚠️ SO IT IS READ INSIDE EACH FUNCTION BELOW, NEVER ONCE UP HERE. A module is
// evaluated at first import, before any venue is open; a value captured at this level
// would freeze the fallback into every price on the page. It is the v1.57.0 defect,
// and money is the one place where being quietly wrong looks exactly like being right.
//
// ⚠️ NOTHING HERE CONVERTS. Only the symbol changes; every stored number is used as
// typed. See js/currency.js.
import { currentCurrency } from './currency.js';

// What a price can be quoted PER. Deliberately three, and deliberately not the

// app started in. Resolve with priceUnitLabel() at the moment of drawing.

// Prices entered before the rate became a typed field carry both, and an
// ingredient is saved with a MERGE — a field left out of the payload keeps
// whatever it had. So the patch sets them to null EXPLICITLY, which is the only
