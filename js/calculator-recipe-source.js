// calculator-recipe-source.js — where a Calculator tab's ingredients come from. PURE.
//
// Federico, 14 Aug 2026: «calculator non ha più ricette proprie ma le prende da
// recipe catalogue». One recipe, in one place, edited in one screen — instead of
// the two copies that exist today and silently disagree the moment one is fixed.
//
// ⚠️⚠️ IT READS BOTH SHAPES, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT OF SHIPPING IT FIRST.
// The rule this project paid for in July: the data moved before the code could
// read it, and the app was left with no weights at all, for everybody. So the
// code that understands BOTH the old shape (a tab carrying its own ingredients)
// and the new one (a tab pointing at a Catalogue recipe) goes live FIRST, works
// with today's untouched data, and only then is anything linked.
//
// No DOM, no Firestore. Every rule below is asserted in a unit test, because the
// numbers it decides are how much dough gets made.

// ── What can go wrong, named ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// ⚠️ A LINKED RECIPE THAT CANNOT BE READ MUST REFUSE, NOT BAKE WITH NOTHING. An
// empty ingredient list computes perfectly happily and produces a dough of zero —
// which is the July defect wearing a different hat. Every problem below means the
// tab says what is wrong and calculates nothing.
