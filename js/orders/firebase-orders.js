// a FIELD (`date`, descending, which is fully supported) — and the one legacy
// weekly document has no `date` field, so it would silently drop out of History.

// So: revisit when orders-history passes ~1000 documents. Then add `date` to the

// orderBy('date','desc') + limit. Not before — today the collection holds two
