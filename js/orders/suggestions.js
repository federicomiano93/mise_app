// suggestions.js — smart order suggestion engine.
//
// Per Federico: the app learns a target "par" level from history and suggests
// how much to order so that, after the stock on hand, you reach that level —
// always topping up to your usual amount.
//
//   par         = average, over the recent ORDERS of that ingredient, of
//                 (stock on hand + quantity ordered)
//   suggestion  = round( par − current stock ), floored at 0
//
// The window counts ORDERS, not weeks. An order is now one day and one supplier
// (archive.js), and suppliers are not all weekly: Salvo is ordered on Mondays,
// Caterite almost daily. Averaging "the last 8 weeks" would silently mean
// something different for each supplier. "The last 8 times you ordered this
// ingredient" means the same thing for all of them — and for a weekly supplier it
// is the same window as before.
//
// Records that predate the per-day model (one document per ISO week, every
// supplier merged) still count as one order each: they carry the same
// quantities/stock maps and sort on weekStart instead of date.
//
// Bank holidays do NOT change the suggestion — they are alert-only (a week-before
// notice and a delivery-day-conflict notice).

// alternative (enumerating every allowed number) would reject a legitimately large
// order, so it was deliberately not done. That leaves this function as the place the
// app stops trusting what it reads: a corrupt value, a bad migration, or a bug of our
// own would otherwise flow straight into `qty + stock` — where a string CONCATENATES
// rather than adds, turning par into NaN and putting "Suggested: NaN" on screen.
// P20: clamp to sane ranges, never produce NaN.

// as before the unit choice existed.

// is high enough to let 300 through. What DOES catch it is the app's own memory of
// how much of that ingredient is normally ordered.
//
// Two conditions, both needed:
//   * FACTOR — several times the usual amount. A typed digit multiplies by ten, so
//     four times over is comfortably past anything routine while leaving room for a
//     genuinely big week.
//   * MARGIN — and at least this much more in absolute terms. Without it, an
//     ingredient usually ordered 1 or 2 at a time would flag 8, which is an ordinary
//     Saturday, and a warning that cries wolf is one people tap through.
//
// Silent when there is no par yet (fewer than 4 past orders): with no idea what
// "usual" means for this ingredient, there is nothing honest to warn about.
