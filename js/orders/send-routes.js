//
// ⚠️⚠️ THIS IS A SIGNPOST, NOT A LOCK, AND SAYING SO IS PART OF THE FEATURE.
// WhatsApp and email live OUTSIDE this app: it opens a link, and there is no server
// call anybody could refuse. No setting here can stop a person opening WhatsApp on
// their own phone. What it genuinely does is remove the road from the app, so nobody
// takes it by habit or by accident and the normal way becomes "send it to the
// manager" — and the message itself is BUILT by the app, so going round it means
// retyping thirty ingredients by hand. It discourages; it does not forbid.
//
// ⚠️ THE DECISION, THOUGH, IS CLOSED PROPERLY: who may change these settings is
// enforced by the database rules, not by a hidden button. Hiding a control is
// courtesy, never security (v269).
