// reminders.js — the two things the Orders screen must tell you the moment it
// opens. Pure: no Firestore, no DOM.
//
//   1. todayOrders      — which suppliers are ordered TODAY, and which of them
//                         you have already placed (the record {today}_{supplier}
//                         exists). Before the per-day model there was no way to
//                         know the second half, so this reminder was switched off.
//   2. pendingSuppliers — an order you typed on an earlier day and never marked
//                         as placed. It must be filed under the day it was
//                         WRITTEN, not today, so the day is carried per supplier
//                         in the draft (drafts/current.days).

// One definition of "already ordered", used by the Orders screen (which ticks them
// off) AND by the Home badge (which must not count them). Two copies of this would
// drift, and the drift would show as the Home nagging about an order the Orders
// screen has already ticked off.

// `days` is the draft's per-supplier stamp. A draft written before this feature
// existed has no stamp at all, so `fallbackDay` (the local day of the draft's own
// updatedAt) stands in — otherwise the very orders this is meant to rescue would
// be the only ones it could not see. A supplier that has been deleted or
// deactivated is ignored: its stamp can linger forever and nagging about rows
// nobody can see would never stop.
