// no-supplier.js — the pseudo-supplier for things bought without one. PURE.
//
// Plenty of what the bakery buys has no supplier: the supermarket, the cash &
// carry, the shop down the road. Those are ordinary ingredients and must behave
// like ordinary ingredients — same card, same row, same order flow.
//
// But the whole order flow is keyed by supplier: the draft stamps a day per
// supplier, an order is archived as orders-history/{day}_{supplierId}, the
// tick-lists are lists of suppliers. So "no supplier" needs a supplier to belong
// to, and it gets a fake one.
//
// It is NEVER written to the `suppliers` collection — it lives only in the page's
// memory, assembled here on every render. What DOES reach Firestore is the string
// 'no-supplier' as an ingredient's supplierId and as half of a history document id
// ("2026-07-29_no-supplier"). Both were checked against firestore.rules: a
// non-empty supplierId string and the "YYYY-MM-DD_<anything>" id pattern. No rules
// change, no rules deploy.

import { t } from '../i18n.js';

// ⚠️ THE ID ITSELF LIVES IN js/records.js since 13 Sep 2026: the ingredient card is shared
// with the Catalogue, which may not import this folder, and a stored id must never exist in
// two spellings.
import { NO_SUPPLIER_ID } from '../records.js';
export { NO_SUPPLIER_ID };

// Frozen: it is handed to the same code that handles real suppliers, and a single
// shared object that anything could quietly mutate would be a very confusing bug.
// ⚠️ `name` IS RESOLVED HERE AND THAT IS A KNOWN COMPROMISE. This object is handed
// straight to code that expects a real supplier document, which carries a plain
// `name` string — giving it a key instead would mean teaching every one of those
// places that this one supplier is different, which is worse. Instead the object is
// rebuilt whenever the language changes: see noSupplier() below, which every caller
// uses. The frozen constant stays for the id and the shape.

// screen use this function; the constant remains for the id, the shape and the tests.

//
// This is the ONE place that decides an ingredient's supplier. Everything
// downstream (which card it sits on, which order it is archived into, which rows
// are cleared afterwards) reads the resolved value, so those three can never
// disagree — which is exactly what would happen if the flat list merely DREW
// orphans under "No supplier" while the order flow still went by the stored id.
//
// `suppliersLoaded` is not optional. Suppliers and ingredients arrive from
// Firestore in separate snapshots, and before the supplier one lands every single
// supplier is "missing": resolving then would flash all 65 ingredients as
// "No supplier" for a frame. Untouched list until the suppliers are really in.
