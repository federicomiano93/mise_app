// draft.js — the persistent, real-time order in progress.
//
// One shared document, drafts/current, holds every supplier's quantities. Every
// change autosaves (debounced) so reopening the app restores the exact state, and
// a real-time listener keeps two phones in sync.
//
// It also remembers, per supplier, the DAY its rows were last touched
// (`days: { supplierId: 'YYYY-MM-DD' }`). Without that the app cannot tell an
// order typed today from one typed on Sunday and never marked as placed — and it
// would file the Sunday order under today.
//
// Archiving is per supplier: it writes orders-history/{day}_{supplierId} and
// removes ONLY that supplier's keys from the draft. The other suppliers' work —
// including whatever someone else is typing right now — is left alone.
