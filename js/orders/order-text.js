// order-text.js — the WhatsApp message for an order. PURE: no DOM, no Firestore.
//
// Extracted from preview.js because the same text is now built from two different
// sources: the draft (the order you are typing) and a history record (an order
// already placed, which you may want to send, or send again). Keeping one builder
// means the supplier can never receive two differently-formatted messages for the
// same order.
//
// Pure and DOM-free on purpose, following js/calculator-recipe-text.js — that module
// exists for exactly this reason, so the text can be asserted in a unit test instead
// of being re-read out of rendered markup (P15).
//
// The format is deliberately unchanged from what the app has always sent:
//   *Order — The Italian Club*
//
//   *Supplier name*
//   - Bacon 2.27kg: 5
//   - Mozzarella 1kg: 2
//
// The order unit (casse/box) is a private reminder on the order screen and is NOT in
// the message — the supplier gets the number only. An empty weight is skipped.
//
// The name in the title is the LOCATION PLACING THE ORDER, passed in by the caller
// from the session. It used to be the constant 'The Italian Club', which was harmless
// with one location and wrong the moment there were two: a supplier would receive
// another location's order signed with this one's name. With no name the title
// falls back to a plain '*Order*' — anonymous is recoverable, wrong is not.
