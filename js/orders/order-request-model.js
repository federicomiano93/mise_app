// order-request-model.js — an order list one person sends to another. PURE.
//
// Until now Orders had ONE list per location (drafts/current, shared and live) and
// ONE way out of it: the WhatsApp button. So whoever wrote the list was necessarily
// whoever passed it to the suppliers. This splits the two — somebody prepares the
// list, sends it inside the app, and a manager works through it and orders.
//
// No DOM and no Firestore here, so every rule below is asserted by a unit test
// rather than read back out of a rendered screen (P15). The numbers this file
// freezes are what somebody will actually buy.
//
// ⚠️ IT LIVES IN js/orders/ AND BELONGS TO ORDERS. The Home imports it for its
// badge, which is the ONE sanctioned place a feature signal surfaces outside its
// own folder (js/home-orders-badge.js already imports from here for the same
// reason). Nothing else may.

// ⚠️ A CAP, BECAUSE THE RULES CANNOT COUNT WHAT THEY CANNOT SEE. firestore.rules
// caps each map's size; this is the same number at this end, so a list too big is
// refused HERE with something a person can read, instead of coming back as a bare
// permission error from Firestore with nothing explaining it.

// ⚠️ NEVER THE RAW uid, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS FUNCTION. A list
// headed "From Fdx92kQ1nT" tells nobody anything, and the one question the
// receiver has is who it came from. Same reasoning, same order of preference, as
// recordedName() for a deleted ingredient.
//
// The roster row is a LABEL, never an identity (see locations/{lid}/members) — so
// this is only ever what the screen prints, and no decision is ever taken on it.

// Turn the chosen suppliers' slice of the shared draft into the document that is
// sent. Returns null when there is nothing to order — there is no such thing as an
// empty order list, and the rules refuse one too.
//
// ⚠️ FLAT MAPS, NOT A NESTED LIST, AND IT IS NOT A STYLE CHOICE. firestore.rules
// cannot look inside a list (the same reason the WhatsApp free lines needed no
// rules change), so a nested shape could only ever be checked for being a list at
// all. With maps every part gets a type and a size. It is also the exact shape of
// orders-history, which has carried real orders for a year.
//
// ⚠️ ONLY ROWS WITH qty > 0, exactly like buildSupplierArchive. A row somebody
// left at 0 is a row they decided NOT to order; carrying it here would put a line
// on the manager's screen that nobody asked for, and it can never be ticked off
// as bought.
