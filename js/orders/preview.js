// preview.js — "Send order on WhatsApp" for the order IN PROGRESS.
//
// Opened by the header WhatsApp button. Shows a tick per supplier that has items in
// the current draft, builds ONE message grouped by supplier, and opens WhatsApp with
// NO recipient — the operator picks the chat himself (the whole app sends this way;
// see js/whatsapp.js and js/orders/order-text.js).
//
// The screen itself is supplier-picker.js and the text is order-text.js, both shared
// with the bulk "Order placed" flow and with re-sending an order from History. What
// is left here is the one thing specific to sending a DRAFT: reporting which
// suppliers went out, so the caller can offer to mark exactly those as placed.
//
// Sending is the moment the order actually leaves, so it is the moment to ask —
// forgetting to record it afterwards was the whole problem.
