// deliveries.js — what has been ordered and has not arrived yet, and what is still

//
// PURE: no DOM, no Firestore, so every rule below can be asserted in a test (P15).
//
// ⚠️⚠️ THE WHOLE FEATURE RESTS ON ONE DECISION: THE APP IS TOLD WHAT ARRIVED, IT
// DOES NOT GUESS. A supplier's `deliveryDays` say when a delivery is EXPECTED; they
// are not a record that anything turned up. The obvious cheaper design — drop an
// order off the list once its expected day has passed — fails in the one direction
// that matters: the order nobody delivered would be the only one you never see, and
// the screen would look perfectly healthy, empty. So an order leaves this list when
// somebody says it arrived, and never on its own.
//
// The second decision, Federico's, 14 Aug 2026: an ingredient that did not arrive is
// MARKED, never removed from the order. `orders-history.quantities` is the same map
// the suggestion engine averages over, so deleting from it would quietly change what
// the app suggests for months — and it would also destroy the evidence that the thing
// was ordered at all, which is exactly what you need to chase a supplier.
