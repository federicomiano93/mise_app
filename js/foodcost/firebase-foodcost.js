// firebase-foodcost.js — Firestore data layer for the Food Cost screen.
//
// Reuses the Firebase app and the SESSION established by js/firebase.js (the one
// sanctioned cross-file bridge), so this page shares the signed-in account, the
// open location, the localhost emulator switch and App Check.
//
// Collections, all under the current location's folder (js/location.js):
//   locations/{lid}/products/{id}                — a finished product
//   locations/{lid}/products/{id}/snapshots/{id} — append-only margin history
//
// It also READS two collections it does not own: `recipes` (the catalogue's, to
// cost the components) and `ingredients` (Orders', for packaging). That is a
// shared COLLECTION, not a shared module — js/foodcost/ imports nothing from
// js/catalogue/ or js/orders/, so the feature stays liftable.
