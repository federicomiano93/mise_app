// update-gate.js — WHETHER to force an update on the operator right now. PURE:
// no DOM, no service worker, so the decision can be asserted in a test instead of
// being reasoned about (P15). The screen it produces lives in js/sw-update.js.
//
// WHY FORCING AT ALL. The update banner could be ignored for ever, and this app has
// already paid for that: v1.11.0 tightened the Firestore rules, and phones still on
// the previous version had their History edits refused — loud, but only for the
// person holding that phone. Rules reach every device the instant they deploy while
// code arrives one device at a time, so "some phones are months behind" is not a
// tidiness problem, it is how two people end up with an app that disagrees about
// what is allowed.
//
// WHY IT IS SAFE TO BLOCK. The gate only ever appears when the new worker is already
// INSTALLED and waiting, which means the new files are already on the phone.
// Activating it is a local operation and needs no network. The escape hatch below is
// a seatbelt, not a routine path.

// How many failed attempts before the operator is allowed to carry on regardless.
// A kitchen mid-service cannot be left with an app that refuses to open because
// something went wrong on the way to activating a worker.

// form holding typing that a reload would throw away.
//
// Typing a QUANTITY is deliberately absent. The order draft autosaves every 800ms,
// so a reload loses nothing — and treating every keystroke as "busy" on a screen
// that is nothing but number fields would mean the gate never appears at all.
//
// ⚠️ EVERY SELECTOR HERE MUST MATCH ONLY WHAT IS ON SCREEN. The Orders and Catalogue
// entries are built and removed as they are used, so being in the document IS being
// visible. The CALCULATOR is the opposite: its sixteen overlays and modals are
// declared in calculator.html and merely hidden, so they are in the document from
// the moment the page loads — matching them by id alone would make the app look
// permanently busy and the gate would never appear at all. They are shown by adding
// `.visible` (one convention, used by every one of them), so that class is what the
// selectors below key on. A new selector for a statically declared element MUST
// carry the same qualifier.
