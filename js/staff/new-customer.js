// new-customer.js — "New customer": the first step of every sale.
//
// ⚠️ THIS SCREEN IS THE REASON THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL. createWorkspace has been
// deployed and correct since 11 Aug 2026 and NOTHING CALLED IT — found on 12 Aug
// by walking a fake sale end to end on the emulator. The server half and the app
// half were each correct on their own, so every test stayed green while the app
// had no way to sell itself. That is what this closes.
//
// Like people.js this is an OVERLAY ON THE HOME, not a page: a page would need a
// name in js/sections.js, and a section missing from a location document defaults
// to ON — so adding one would switch it on for every venue that already exists.
//
// ⚠️ AND IT IS FOR THE APP'S OWNER, NOT A CUSTOMER'S. `session.isAppAdmin` is a
// different question from `session.isOwner`: one creates businesses, the other
// hires into one. The function checks admins/{uid} itself and refuses anybody
// else, so what is drawn here is courtesy, never the protection (P2).

// hours on 13 Aug 2026, and Federico hit the defect it causes within minutes of
// opening the app: the screen defaults to "for a customer", so his own bakery was
// created as a customer's and he could not get into it. The two entry points
// already say which is meant, and a screen that asks anyway is a screen that can
// be answered wrongly:
//
//   Choose location  → the list of HIS venues        → 'self'
//   Customer businesses → the app's customer list    → 'customer'
//
// ⚠️ AND THE TWO OUTCOMES ARE GENUINELY DIFFERENT, not a wording choice. For a
// customer the caller does NOT become a member — their data, their staff, their
// prices, and whoever sells the app has no business holding those keys. For one
// of his own there is nobody to invite, so he is made owner on the spot. That is
// exactly why the answer must not be one tap away from the wrong one.

// a business was created or not. ⚠️ It fires on CLOSE and not on success, because
// a business created and then walked away from is exactly the one the list has to
// show: it is stranded, and its link cannot be shown again.
// `host` is where the overlay is mounted, and it matters in exactly one case —
// the same one openBusinesses documents. Opened from the Businesses screen it
// belongs on the body; opened from a screen drawn INSIDE the auth cover (the
// "Choose location" list, added 13 Aug 2026) it must be mounted in the cover,
// because the cover marks every other child of <body> `inert` and a panel out
