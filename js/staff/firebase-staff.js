// the documents that decide who may enter are writable by no client at all, so

// after checking who asked. See functions/onboarding.js for why.
//
// The one thing this file reads directly is the roster
// (locations/{lid}/members), which exists precisely because users/{uid} is
// readable only by its own owner — without it, an owner could never list their
// own staff.

// ── The four ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

// ⚠️⚠️ THESE THREE AWAIT signedInReady, NOT sessionReady, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS
// THE WHOLE SCREEN WORKING OR HANGING FOR EVER.
//
// They are reached from the Misé home, which sits ABOVE every location — and
// they are about businesses their caller is deliberately NOT a member of, so
// there is no location involved at any point. sessionReady resolves when a
// location OPENS, which on that screen never happens: the Businesses list sat on
// "Loading…" indefinitely, with no error, nothing in the console and nothing on
// screen. Found by driving the app; the panel mounted, was tappable and had its
// title and its button, so every check about the panel passed.
//
// ⚠️ signedInReady gives the guarantee these calls actually needed and always
// did: that the auth token has been restored. Firing before it, a callable
// answers `unauthenticated` — "you are not allowed" when the truth is "you were
// not asked yet". Waiting for a location was only ever a way of waiting for that.
//
// ⚠️ THE VENUE CALLS BELOW KEEP sessionReady, and must. They read
// currentSession().locationId, so for them a location really does have to be
// open — swapping them over would let one fire with no location and send
// `undefined` as the place to write to.
//
// ⚠️ And none of these three takes a locationId from currentSession(): they are
// about the app's customers, never about the place you happen to have open.

// Create a business. `opts.forSelf` decides who ends up inside it:
//   false (default) → a CUSTOMER's business: returns a one-time link, and the
//                     caller does NOT become a member. Their data, their keys.
//   true            → ONE OF MINE: the caller is made owner on the spot, in one
//                     transaction, and NO link is minted. firstName/lastName go
//                     on the roster row, exactly as redeeming a code would.
//
// ⚠️ The two are not a style choice. Adding a business to yourself through the
// customer route means redeeming a link with an email that already has an
// account — refused by Firebase, and the reason Federico could not add his
// second business on 13 Aug 2026.
