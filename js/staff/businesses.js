// businesses.js — "Businesses": the customers of this app.
//
// ⚠️ WHY IT EXISTS, and it is not tidiness. locations/{lid} is readable only by a
// MEMBER, and whoever creates a customer is deliberately not one — so until this
// screen a business created here was invisible from the moment it was made, and
// its link (stored only as a sha256) was unrecoverable if it never arrived. The
// Firebase console was the only way back.
//
// ⚠️ AND WHY IT IS SEPARATE FROM THE HOME. The Home belongs to a VENUE — its
// header says the venue's name. "New customer" sat in the strip at its foot
// between "Who can get in" (about this venue) and "Log out" (about your account):
// three different scopes in one list. Federico spotted it on his own phone.
//
// An OVERLAY, like people.js, not a page: a page would want a name in
// js/sections.js, and a section missing from a location document counts as ON —
// so adding one switches it on for every venue that already exists and needs
// `sections.<name>: false` typed into each of them in the console first.
