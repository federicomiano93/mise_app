// "App language" — the one screen where somebody chooses what the staff read.
//
// ⚠️⚠️ IT SAYS, EVERY TIME, THAT IT DOES NOT MOVE THE LABELS. That sentence is
// not decoration and it is not an apology: an allergen label must be in the
// language of the country the food is SOLD in (retained Reg. 1169/2011), so the
// label follows `country` and nothing else. Somebody who set the app to Italian
// and assumed their English labels had followed would be wrong in the one place
// this app can hurt a person. The screen states it in the same breath as the
// choice, not in a footnote at the end of a scroll.
//
// ⚠️ OWNER AND MANAGER ONLY, which includes a head chef (they hold 'manager').
// Federico's rule: everybody else uses the app's language and cannot change it.
// The card simply is not drawn for an employee — and the server refuses them as
// well, because hiding a control is courtesy, never security (P2).
//
// ⚠️ AND IT RELOADS. Every screen in this app reads its words at draw time, but
// dozens of them are already drawn when this returns — the venue's Home, the
// strip behind it, whatever was open before. Repainting all of them from here is
// a promise nobody could keep; a reload is honest and takes a moment. Same
// reasoning as switchLocation().
