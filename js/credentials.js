// credentials.js — what somebody types on the way in: their name, and a password.
//
// PURE, so the awkward cases can be tested without a browser: a name that is all
// spaces, a surname pasted with a newline in it, a password that is the person's
// own email address. Every check here runs BEFORE the network, which matters for
// a reason that is not politeness — see the note on the join screen: a malformed
// attempt still spends one of the account's five join attempts an hour.
//
// ⚠️ THE PASSWORD RULE IS A GUARD IN THE APP, NOT A RULE OF THE SERVER, AND THAT
// HAS TO BE SAID PLAINLY. Firebase's own floor is SIX characters and cannot be
// raised without Identity Platform, which is a paid tier. So a determined person
// can still make a six-character password by talking to Firebase directly. What
// this stops is the ordinary case — somebody choosing `123456` on the one screen
// where a password is ever chosen — and that is most of the value, but it is not
// enforcement and must not be described as if it were.

// ⚠️ TEN, NOT EIGHT. Length is the only property that reliably costs an attacker
// anything; the usual "a capital and a number" rules mostly produce Password1
// and teach people to write passwords down. One number to explain, one to change.
