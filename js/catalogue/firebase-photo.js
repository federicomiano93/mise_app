//   { ok: true,  recipe, notes, remaining }
//   { ok: false, reason }        ← the call worked; there was no recipe to find
// and REJECTS only when the call itself failed. Those two are different things
// and the screen says different sentences for them.
//
// ⚠️ sessionReady, NOT signedInReady: this call carries a locationId, so it needs a
// location to be OPEN and not merely an account to be signed in. Sent too early it
// would answer 'unauthenticated', which reads exactly like being logged out.
//
// ⚠️⚠️ AND THE LOCATION IS READ HERE, AFTER THAT WAIT — NEVER PASSED IN FROM THE
// SCREEN. The first version took it as an argument and the screen resolved it once,
// while rendering. currentLocationId() returns null before a location is open (it is
// pathFor that throws, not this), so the screen froze a null and every read
// afterwards came back "which location?" — for the life of that screen.
//
// It was a RACE, which is the worst part: the same code read a recipe perfectly on
// one run and refused on the next, with nothing on screen distinguishing them. Found
// by driving the app twice. Reading it at call time cannot race, because by then the
// wait above has already finished.
