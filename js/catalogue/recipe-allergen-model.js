// recipe-allergen-model.js — which allergens a recipe contains, gathered from the
// ingredients its rows point at. PURE, and asserted under Node (P15).
//
// ⚠️⚠️ IT LOOKS LIKE recipe-cost-model.js AND ITS CONCLUSION IS THE OPPOSITE.
//
// Both walk the same links, both meet the same gaps: a row nobody linked, an
// ingredient with nothing filled in, a sub-recipe that is itself incomplete. The
// cost model answers those by giving a PARTIAL number and saying so — a price per
// kilo of the part it could price, which is a useful, honest, slightly-too-low
// answer.
//
// Here a partial answer is not slightly wrong, it is DANGEROUS. The row nobody
// linked could be the one with the hazelnuts. So:
//
//     complete === false  ⇒  NOTHING may be printed as a label.
//
// The list of allergens found is still returned, because a working sheet can show
// "so far we know about milk and wheat, and these four rows are unaccounted for"
// — that is a job list. What must never happen is that list being presented as a
// declaration. The screens enforce it; this file makes it impossible to miss by
// putting `complete` in the same object.
//
// ⚠️ IT LIVES IN js/catalogue/ BESIDE recipe-cost-model.js, and Food Cost imports
// it the same way it already imports that one (foodcost-main.js:20). Walking a
// recipe's rows needs to know how a catalogue row is shaped — unitOf, linkOf,
// ingredientGrams — so the walk belongs where that shape is defined. The
// alternative, a second copy of the walk, is the thing this project refuses.

// Why a row could not be accounted for. The order is the order they are TESTED
// in, and each names one thing to go and do — the same shape as COST_REASON_TEXT
// in the cost model, so the two screens read alike.
//
// ⚠️ 'not-weighable' IS NOT AN EXCUSE HERE, and that is the sharpest difference
// from the cost model. A pinch of something still contains what it contains; a
// row measured in spoons can be pure mustard. The cost model can skip those
// because a pinch costs nothing worth counting — an allergen declaration cannot.
