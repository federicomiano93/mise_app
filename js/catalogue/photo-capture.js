// photo-capture.js — photograph a recipe, and have it typed in for you.
//
// Federico, 22 Aug 2026. Loading a recipe means typing every line by hand, and a
// recipe book has hundreds. So: take the photographs, the reader turns them into a
// draft, and the ORDINARY recipe editor opens with the draft in it.
//
// ⚠️⚠️ NOTHING HERE EVER SAVES ANYTHING. A machine reading handwriting is sometimes
// confidently wrong, and 100 g read as 1000 g looks exactly like a number somebody
// typed. Every value goes to the editor as a working copy and waits for the same
// Save, and the same "Save these changes?", as a recipe typed by hand.
//
// ⚠️ IT IS THE ONLY SCREEN IN THIS APP THAT CANNOT WORK OFFLINE. Everything else is
// local-first; this one needs a reader that lives somewhere else. So it says so
// plainly, and it never blames the connection for anything but a missing one.
