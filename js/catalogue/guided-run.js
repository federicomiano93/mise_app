// guided-run.js — following a recipe's mixing procedure, one step at a time.
//
// The screen someone stands in front of with their hands in dough, so it is built
// for exactly that: one instruction at a time, the amounts big enough to read from
// a step back, and a countdown that is right whatever the phone did while nobody
// was looking.
//
// ⚠️ EVERYTHING TIME-RELATED COMES FROM guided-model.js AND IS DERIVED FROM THE
// CLOCK. Nothing in this file counts seconds; the interval below only repaints.
// See the note in the model for why — a decrementing counter on a backgrounded
// phone comes back showing a time that never happened.
//
// ⚠️ THE RUN WORKS AGAINST A FROZEN SNAPSHOT, NOT THE LIVE RECIPE. The catalogue
// is a live listener: a recipe edited on another phone arrives mid-screen. Doing
// that here would change the amounts under somebody's hands halfway through a
// dough. The snapshot is taken on Start, exactly as the Calculator freezes a
// recipe onto a log and Orders freezes the item names onto a record.
