// editor would throw away what somebody has typed, which is why this has always
// been narrow. The photo screen is the exception that is safe: it holds only the
// photographs, and its own paint() rebuilds them — so it repaints itself (see
// photo-capture.js) and only its HEADER, which lives out here, is re-applied.
// ⚠️⚠️ THE LIST IS DRAWN BEFORE THE SESSION IS READY, EVERY TIME, and until now
// nothing redrew it when the session arrived. Measured: at one second `canManage` is
// false and the venue document is null; at three seconds both are right and the
// screen still shows what it painted at one.
//
// It was invisible while nothing on the list depended on the session. The photograph
// switch does — it is shown only to an owner or a manager, and only when the venue
// has it on — so an owner opening the Catalogue simply never saw it, for ever. Not a
// race: a certainty, hidden only by the fact that a language change happened to
// repaint the list as a side effect.
//
// ⚠️ ONCE, AND ONLY FROM THE LIST. Repainting on every session change would rebuild
// the screen under somebody's fingers; repainting any other view would throw away
// what they had typed. Same rule, same reason, as the language handler below.
