// allergen-sheet.js — the screen you CONSULT about allergens, plus the work list
// that says which ingredients to declare first.
//
// Two audiences, and they want opposite things:
//
//   Somebody at the counter, asked "does this contain nuts?", wants an answer NOW
//   and needs to be able to see instantly that a recipe has no answer yet.
//
//   Somebody filling the data in wants to know where to start — and the honest
//   answer is almost never "at the top of a list of 65". A handful of ingredients
//   appear in nearly everything, so declaring six can unblock twenty recipes while
//   the other fifty-nine matter to one recipe each.
//
// ⚠️ RESHAPED 22 Aug 2026 ON FEDERICO'S INSTRUCTION, after he opened it expecting
// to read what a recipe contains and found a to-do list. Top to bottom it is now:
// what the LAW requires here · where things stand · a search · the work · every
// recipe with its own allergens. The work lists stayed (his decision) because with
// nothing linked yet they are still the only thing this screen can tell him — but
// they are capped at six and step out of the way while he is searching.
