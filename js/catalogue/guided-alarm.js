// guided-alarm.js — the sound a finished step makes, and keeping the screen lit.
//
// Two small pieces of the phone, kept together because they are the two things a
// guided mix needs from the device and the two things this project cannot test
// from a desktop.
//
// ── The sound ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// ⚠️ A FILE, NOT A SYNTHESISED TONE, AND NOT A data: URI.
//
//   A `data:` URI is refused outright: every page here declares
//   `default-src 'self'` and sets no media-src, so the audio would simply never
//   load — and it would fail on the phone while working in whatever tool it was
//   written with.
//
//   Web Audio (an oscillator) needs no file at all, which is tempting, but on iOS
//   it is the variant most reliably silenced by the ring/silent switch. An alarm
//   that is quiet exactly when the bakery is loud is not an alarm.
//
// sounds/alarm.wav is one second: three beeps and a gap, so `loop` repeats it
// seamlessly. 16 KB, 8 kHz mono — an alarm is not music, and this ships to every
// phone. Regenerate with a sine at 880 Hz, 100 ms on / 100 ms off × 3, 500 ms
// tail, 8 ms fade at each edge so no beep starts on a click.
//
// ⚠️ AND THE SOUND IS NEVER THE ONLY SIGNAL. It can be muted by a hardware switch
// nobody in this app can read, so a finished step also lights the screen (the
// wake lock below has kept it on) and vibrates where that exists. If the beep
// never arrives, the guided mix still works.

// what turns this from a page into a kitchen timer: the phone sits on the bench,
// lit, showing the countdown.
//
// The lock itself (and why it must be re-requested when the page becomes visible
// again) lives in js/wake-lock.js, shared with kiosk mode and counted by owner.
