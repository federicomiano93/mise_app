// guided-model.js — PURE: a recipe's mixing procedure, and the maths of running it.
//
// No DOM, no Firebase, no localStorage, no `Date.now()` read from inside — every
// function that cares about time is handed `nowMs`. That is what makes the timer
// testable at all: a countdown you can only observe by waiting is a countdown
// nobody ever tests.
//
// A procedure is an ORDERED list of steps stored on the recipe itself:
//
//   steps: [ { text, rows: [rid, …], seconds, speed }, … ]
//
// ⚠️ A STEP HAS NO ID, ON PURPOSE. Nothing outside the array ever points at a
// step: the array is ordered, it lives inside the one document, reordering is
// moving an element, and a run in progress is frozen against a SNAPSHOT rather
// than the live recipe. An id would be a second thing to keep unique and in step
// with the order, buying nothing. The ingredient ROWS are the opposite case —
// see `rid` below.

// ⚠️ A STEP POINTS AT A ROW BY `rid`, NEVER BY NAME AND NEVER BY POSITION, AND

//   that adds it, and the dough is mixed without it.
//
//   By position: inserting one row at the top shifts every reference down by one,
//   so the butter step asks for the yeast — with nothing anywhere saying so. That
//   is the worst shape a bug can have here, because the screen still looks right.
//
// ⚠️ AND THE IDS ARE RANDOM, NOT SEQUENTIAL. Sequential ids ("r1, r2, r3…") are
// easier to read and would reintroduce exactly the failure above by another door:
// two phones editing the same recipe offline would each mint `r4` for a DIFFERENT
// ingredient, and whichever synced last would silently rebind the other phone's
// step to the wrong row. With random ids that collision cannot happen; the step
// reports its row as missing instead, which is visible.
