// recipe-cost-model.js — what a recipe costs per kilo. PURE: no DOM, no Firestore,
// so every rule below is asserted under Node (P15).
//
// THE ONE SENTENCE: a row that points at a priced ingredient contributes both its
// COST and its WEIGHT; a row that points at nothing contributes NEITHER, and the
// recipe says so out loud.
//
// ⚠️ THAT IS WHY THE WEIGHT USED HERE IS NOT THE RECIPE'S TOTAL WEIGHT. If 8 rows
// out of 10 are linked, the price per kilo is the price per kilo OF THOSE 8 — an
// honest partial answer. Dividing their cost by the FULL weight instead would look
// like a complete answer and be quietly too low, which is the one failure mode
// that matters here: a food cost that is wrong in the direction of "we are making
// money". Every screen showing this number must show `partial` with it.
//
// ⚠️ AND A ROW IS COSTED FROM ITS SUPPLIER'S PRICE, not from the batch that was
// actually in the kitchen. Buying elsewhere for a week because the van did not
// come leaves no trace here. Declared, accepted, and not worth asking anyone to
// record every substitution.
