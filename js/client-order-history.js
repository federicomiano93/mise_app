// client-order-history.js — PURE. What a client ORDERED, day by day, after the day
// has been and gone.
//
// The bakery's own screen shows only what is still coming: the query behind it is
// `date >= today`, a deliberate cost decision, because reading every order ever
// received on every app open would be paid for for ever. So the orders were all
// still there and nothing could look at them, which is the gap Federico named:
// «non abbiamo uno storico d'ordine da consultare».
//
// ⚠️⚠️ NOTHING IN THIS FILE DELETES ANYTHING, AND NOTHING EVER MAY.
//
// Federico's rule, in his own words on 5 August 2026: «io posso cancellare dall'app,
// posso cancellare dal database, quello che abbiamo stabilito che si cancella in
// automatico dall'app si cancella ma NIENTE si deve cancellare in automatico dal
// database». So the fifteen days below are a WINDOW ON THE SCREEN. Past that, orders
// stop being drawn and stay in the database for ever; «show older» widens the window.
//
// This app shipped an automatic deletion exactly once — pastry records, v1.24.0 — and
// took it out the following day. It was not switched off but REMOVED, because a delete
// that sits there disabled is one somebody reconnects in six months without knowing
// why it was off. tests/client-order-history.test.mjs pins this module's whole export
// list for that reason: adding anything that decides what to delete turns a test red
// and names it. A rule that lives only in a comment is a rule that comes back.
//
// ⚠️ IT LIVES IN js/ ROOT AND NOT IN js/client-order-model.js, which is shared with
// the CLIENT's own page (js/client-orders/). Putting the bakery's history grouping
// there would ship code to a customer's phone that their page can never use — the same
// reason js/join-link.js is not inside js/join-code.js. And it deliberately does not
// import from js/orders/, where a grouping by day also exists: a feature never imports
// from another feature's folder.

// ordered, which is a different and wrong statement.
