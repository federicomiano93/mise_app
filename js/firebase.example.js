// This module:
//   1. Initializes Firebase and signs the user in anonymously

// ── Calculator configuration (single client address book) ────────────────────
// One shared document: config/calculator. Shared across the team like the log,

//                    crate: { show: bool, perBox: number } } ] } ],

//     extraDough:      { <recipeId>: bool, ... },
//     divisorIncluded: { <recipeId>: [productIds], ... } }
// A product belongs to the CLIENT that orders it — there is no shared catalogue. Two
// clients ordering the same thing hold independent copies (which may share an id, from
// the migration off the old catalogue: divisor ticks, WhatsApp lists, saved log rows
// and typed quantities all key by it). Each product names its recipe; the recipe tabs
// are filtered views of `clients`. product.kind is the input widget: number|dropdown|kg.
// product.active === false parks it: kept here, out of the calculator.
// product.crate optionally shows a per-product "crate box" (how many crates the order
// fills) bound to the product, not its name. `whatsappLists` are INDEPENDENT WhatsApp
// order lists, decoupled from the dough tabs: each list groups client entries, and an
// entry pairs an address-book client (by id) with product ids chosen from ANY client.
// Names resolve live from the address book; deleted clients/products are pruned.
// `extraDough` toggles the per-tab extra-dough box. `divisorIncluded` lists products
// kept IN each tab's divisor box (opt-in: empty = no product is split). Legacy per-tab
// and legacy `groups` documents are migrated on read by normalizeConfig in
// js/calculator-config.js. See firestore.rules.

// ── Orders system (js/orders/*) ──────────────────────────────────────────────
// The supplier-order feature has its own data layer, js/orders/firebase-orders.js,
// which reuses THIS app + anonymous auth (it imports firebaseConfig from here).
// It adds NO export here. Firestore collections it uses, every document carrying
// bakery: "main" (validated in firestore.rules):
//   - suppliers/{id}          { name, category, deliveryDays[], orderDays[], phone,
//                               email, active }
//   - ingredients/{id}        { name, supplierId, category, unit, active,
//                               priceUnit, pricePerUnit, unitWeightKg,
//                               priceUpdatedAt }
//   - ingredient-prices/{id} { priceUnit, pricePerUnit, unitWeightKg,
//                               priceUpdatedAt } — the id is the INGREDIENT's id
//   - ingredients/{id}/prices/{autoId}
//                             { recordedAt, priceUnit, pricePerUnit,
//                               unitWeightKg, supplierId, source }
//
//     ⚠️⚠️ THE PRICE LIVES BESIDE THE INGREDIENT, NOT ON IT, and both of the two
//     above are behind canManage(lid, 'foodcost') — an ordinary employee cannot
//     read either. The reason is that ORDERS MUST READ EVERY INGREDIENT to work
//     at all: that is the order screen. A rate written on the ingredient document
//     is therefore a rate every person in the building can read, whatever the
//     Food Cost screen does — so closing Food Cost hid the MARGIN and left "what
//     a sack of flour costs" in plain view.
//
//     ⚠️ A PARALLEL COLLECTION, NOT A SUBCOLLECTION: Food Cost and the recipe
//     costing want them ALL, and one collection read costs far less than one read
//     per ingredient (P14). js/price-model.js owns splitPriceFields() (which half
//     goes where) and withPrices() (putting them back together for a screen that
//     may see one) — in js/ ROOT, because Orders writes prices while the
//     Catalogue and Food Cost read them, and a feature must never import from
//     another feature's folder.
//
//     ⚠️ A MISSING PRICE IS NOT AN ERROR. An employee is refused the collection,
//     so withPrices() simply returns the ingredient untouched and every screen
//     says "not priced yet" — which most ingredients are anyway. No new failure
//     mode, and nothing to handle.
//
//     ⚠️ THE PRICE FIELDS STAY IN THE ingredients WHITELIST in firestore.rules,
//     written null on every save so they drain out of documents written before
//     the move. Removing a field from a whitelist while production still carries
//     it makes those documents permanently unwritable — the notifyHoursBefore /
//     weekId trap, learnt twice.
//     pricePerUnit is the rate as TYPED (£ per kg / litre / piece, net of VAT).
//     packPrice and packSize are RETIRED — the rate used to be their quotient.
//     Both are still whitelisted in firestore.rules and still accepted here,
//     because documents written before the change carry them and a merge write
//     cannot remove a field by omission. Do not delete them from the rules until
//     production has stopped carrying them.
//   - drafts/current          { entries:{ id:{ qty, stock } },
//                               days:{ supplierId: 'YYYY-MM-DD' }, updatedAt }
//   - orders-history/{YYYY-MM-DD}_{supplierId}
//                             { date, supplierId, supplierName, quantities:{id:qty},
//                               stock:{id:qty}, createdAt, updatedAt }
//
// An order is ONE DAY and ONE SUPPLIER: suppliers are not ordered on the same days
// (Salvo on Mondays, Caterite almost daily), so a single weekly document could not
// say what was ordered, or when. `days` on the draft records which day each
// supplier's rows were typed on, so an order left unmarked overnight is filed
// under the day it was written rather than the day it was finally recorded.
// Documents written by the earlier model (one per ISO week, id "2026-W28", field
// weekStart, every supplier merged) are still read and still counted — nothing was
// migrated.
//
// FOOD COST. locations/{lid}/products/{id} is a finished product — kilos of
// recipes plus packaging counted in pieces — with the price it sells for and the
// food-cost target it is measured against. The selling price is stored GROSS (the
// number on the label) with its own vatRate beside it, and the food cost is worked
// out on the NET price; storing it net instead would make every past margin wrong
// the day a rate changes. `products/{id}/snapshots/{autoId}` is the append-only
// margin series, taken when the price or the composition changes, and it FREEZES
// the VAT rate and the ingredient prices of the moment.
//
// ⚠️ vatRate may legitimately be 0 — most takeaway bakery in the UK is zero-rated.
// Anything treating 0 as "not filled in" refuses to cost the bakery's main line.
//
// RECIPE COSTING. locations/{lid}/recipes/{id} gained `lossPct` (the weight the
// recipe loses while cooking) and each ingredient row may carry `kind`
// ('ingredient' | 'recipe') + `refId`. A linked row contributes both its cost and
// its weight; an unlinked one contributes NEITHER, so the price per kilo is always
// the price per kilo of what was actually costed — partial, and flagged as such.
// The maths is js/catalogue/recipe-cost-model.js. Rules cannot look inside a list,
// so the row shape is guaranteed by js/catalogue/catalogue-model.js.
//
// PRICES. An ingredient carries what it costs, because in Orders an ingredient
// document already IS the pairing of a thing with the supplier who sells it, and a
// price belongs to that pairing rather than to the thing. It is entered as a
// purchase form — pack price, pack size, unit — and normalised into pricePerUnit;
// js/price-model.js is the only place that maths lives (js/ root, not js/orders/,
// because the Recipe catalogue reads it too). Every change also
// appends to the /prices subcollection, in the SAME atomic write, and that
// subcollection is create-only in the rules: it is the record the margin history
// will be rebuilt from, and one that can be edited afterwards answers nothing.
//
// ── Who may do what, inside a location (js/roles.js) ─────────────────────────
// ⚠️ THE ROLE IS THE MEMBERSHIP VALUE, NOT A FIELD BESIDE IT:
//   users/{uid} = { locations: { <lid>: true | 'owner' } }
// `true` is staff and 'owner' is the person whose business it is. Anything else
// — missing, corrupt, a role from a later version — reads as staff, because
// power nobody granted must not exist. That default is also what makes the
// change safe to deploy: every membership written before it says `true`.
//
// js/sections.js accessValue() is the ONE reader, and firestore.rules reads the
// same single value the same way — so a membership and a role can never
// disagree. Only irreversible deletes are gated (suppliers, ingredients,
// recipes, products, client-ordering accounts and menus); everyday writing is
// untouched, because somebody working a shift has to be able to work.
//
// THREE roles: 'owner', 'manager' and the ordinary employee (`true`). The
// manager does everything an owner does INSIDE a location, deleting included;
// what separates them is hiring, which never reaches firestore.rules because
// memberships and join codes are written only by functions/onboarding.js.
//
// ⚠️ SO THE SESSION CARRIES TWO ANSWERS, NOT ONE. session.canManage draws every
// delete button; session.isOwner draws only the "who can get in" entry. Using
// isOwner for a bin takes the bins away from every manager.
//
// ⚠️ AND BOTH ARE UX ONLY (P2). They stop the app drawing a control the database
// would refuse; they are not the security. The security is firestore.rules, and
// the rules trust nothing sent from here.
//
// ── Joining, without the Firebase console (js/staff/*, functions/onboarding.js) ─
// The app can now let somebody in. It adds ONE export here — signUp() above —
// and everything else goes through Cloud Functions, because the documents that
// decide access are `allow write: if false` for every client and always will be.
// Letting the app write another person's users/{uid} would be a master key to
// the whole database, across every location, for ever.
//
// Collections, all written ONLY by the Admin SDK and readable by no client:
//   - admins/{uid}                     the app's own owner; the only account that
//                                      may create a customer's location
//   - join-codes/{sha256(code)}        ⚠️ the code itself is NEVER stored, only
//                                      its hash, so it cannot leak through a
//                                      function log or a database export
//   - rate-limits/{uid}                5 redeem attempts per account per hour
//
// One exception, readable by a location's own members:
//   - locations/{lid}/members/{uid}    { email, role, joinedAt }
//
// ⚠️ members IS A COPY OF A FACT AND IS NOT THE ONE THAT DECIDES. The truth is
// users/{uid}, which is what the rules read; members exists only so an owner can
// SEE the list, since users/{uid} is readable by its own account alone. Both are
// written in the SAME transaction, in the same function, so they cannot part.
//
// ── Push notifications (Firebase Cloud Messaging) — FUTURE / server step ──────
// Client-side alerts (js/orders/notifications.js) already work while the app is
// OPEN. Pushing to staff with the app CLOSED needs the server step, deferred for
// now. When adding it:
//   1. Firebase Console → Cloud Messaging: enable it and create a Web Push
//      certificate (VAPID key pair); keep the PUBLIC vapid key for the client.
//   2. Add a service worker firebase-messaging-sw.js (background receive) that
//      initializes this firebaseConfig and uses getMessaging()/onBackgroundMessage.
//   3. Client: getToken(messaging, { vapidKey }) and store it in a Firestore
//      collection (e.g. fcm-tokens/{token} with bakery:"main") + a matching rule.
//   4. Server (Cloud Functions, Blaze plan) on a schedule: send the order-due,
//      bank-holiday and delivery-conflict messages to the stored tokens.

// collection would turn every app open from 3 reads into 500+, on every phone,
// for ever (P14) — the mistake made and corrected on the Home's order badge.

// been deleted must make the tab REFUSE, not quietly keep using the last copy.
