// calculator-order-prefill.js — PURE: fill a WhatsApp order from what was already
// calculated and logged, so the same quantities are not typed twice.
//
// No DOM, no Firebase, no storage, so it can be unit-tested under Node (P15 — the
// owner cannot read code, and these numbers end up in a message sent to a client).
//
// ⚠️ This deliberately bends P20 ("never auto-fill real-looking values"). It is
// acceptable ONLY because the order modal shows the numbers before anything is sent
// and every one of them can be corrected — and because the screen says where they came
// from. That sentence is not decoration: it is the condition that makes the exception
// honest. If it ever disappears, this should go with it.

// TWO WORK DAYS: today and yesterday. Not a preference — it is how the bakery
// works. Some products are made the day BEFORE the order goes out and some the
// same morning, so today's order is assembled from both days' work and neither
// alone is the answer.
//
// ⚠️ WORK days, so the boundary is 4am and not midnight (workDayIndex). Someone
// shaping at 00:30 is still on last night's shift, and a midnight cut would drop
// their own log out of the window they are standing in.
//
// ⚠️ THIS IS ALSO THE FIX FOR AN OLDER HOLE: there used to be NO limit at all.
// The logs are never deleted — the "keep visible for N hours" setting only hides
// them from the Log screen — so the offer could reach back weeks and present a
// three-week-old quantity as "from your saved logs", with nothing saying how old
// it was. A plausible stale number is the worst kind: nothing on screen looks wrong.

// IN THE WINDOW that recorded one. `logs` must arrive NEWEST FIRST (log-store's
// getLogs already sorts that way) and `latestOf` returns a log's current version.
//
// `nowMs` is the clock and `window` the chosen setting, both passed in so this stays
// pure and testable.
//
// ⚠️ THE NEWEST LOG THAT MENTIONS A ROW DECIDES IT — **ZERO INCLUDED**. This is the
// whole rule, and getting it wrong shipped a real defect: the code used to skip a
// zero and keep searching backwards, on the reasoning that "0 means it was not
// ordered, not that the answer is zero". That reasoning is wrong. A dough log lists
// EVERY product of its recipe, for every client, including the ones at zero — so a
// zero in the newest log is that log saying "none of these today", which is exactly
// an answer.
//
// What it looked like in the bakery: today's brioche log said a client's buns were 0,
// yesterday's said 10, and the order form offered 10 — a quantity nobody had asked
// for, in a message about to be sent to that client, with today's log on screen
// plainly showing zero. Reported the same day.
//
// So a row is decided ONCE, by the first log that names it; only decisions above zero
// are offered, because a zero needs no filling in.
//
// ⚠️ AN UNREADABLE CLOCK OFFERS NOTHING, deliberately. Falling back to "no window"
// would silently restore the unbounded behaviour above — the failure would look
// exactly like the feature working. Offering nothing means the quantities get typed,
// which is merely the old way of doing it.
