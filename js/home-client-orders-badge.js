// home-client-orders-badge.js — the count of client orders still waiting, on the
// Calculator card of the Home screen.
//
// It exists because the Calculator's own banner is only seen by somebody who has
// already opened the Calculator, and the Home is the first screen of the installed
// app. Without this, an order that arrives after the morning's dough is calculated is
// invisible until the next time anybody happens to open that page.
//
// The Home is the shared landing screen — the ONE sanctioned place a feature signal
// may surface outside its own folder (see the modularity note in the project docs).
// It reuses the same data layer and the same pure rule as the Calculator's banner, so
// the two numbers can never disagree.
//
// ⚠️ ONE BOUNDED QUERY, NOT THE WHOLE COLLECTION (P14). The Home is opened many times
// a day on every phone; reading every order ever placed each time would bill for the
// whole archive for ever. `where('date','>=',today)` is a range on a single field, so
// it needs no composite index and no console setup.
