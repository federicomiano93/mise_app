//
// ⚠️ It takes out EVERYTHING that is not the cover, dialogs included. That is
// correct — the cover is the topmost modal and nothing may sit in front of it —
// but it means nothing else may open a dialog while it is up: the dialog would be
// visible, unreachable, and in the way of signing in. js/whats-new-boot.js waits
// for a location to be open for exactly this reason. Anything else that wants to
// interrupt must do the same.
// The update surfaces are the exception. They sit above the cover by design
// (9999 and 10001 vs 9000) and all they do is reload the page — and a phone stuck
// on one of these screens is exactly the phone that most needs to be able to take
// a new version. Switching them off with everything else turns the cover into a
// trap: visible update, untappable.
//
// ⚠️⚠️ BOTH IDS MUST BE HERE, AND FOR A LONG TIME ONLY THE BANNER WAS. The modal
// (`sw-update-gate`) REPLACES the banner — showGate() removes `sw-update-host` on
// the way in — so exempting only the banner meant the one reachable control was
// swapped for an unreachable one. Reported from a phone as "it goes back to the
// update screen but the button will not click, I have to close the app
// completely". Measured on the rendered page: the button was visible, enabled,
// pointer-events auto, at z-index 10001, fully on screen — and carrying `inert`,
// so the tap went to the sign-in form underneath.
//
// ⚠️ IT WAS INTERMITTENT, WHICH IS WHY IT SURVIVED SO LONG. setBehindInert() walks
// the body's children at the moment it runs, so whether the modal is caught
// depends on whether the cover goes up before or after it appears — a race, and
// "sometimes the update sticks" is exactly what a race looks like from a kitchen.
//
// ⚠️ ANYTHING ELSE ADDED HERE MUST BE ABLE TO SIT IN FRONT OF THE SIGN-IN FORM.
// These two earn it because their only action is to reload; a screen that shows
// or asks for anything does NOT (see js/whats-new-boot.js, which waits instead).
