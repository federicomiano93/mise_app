// calculator-config.js — pure data model for the calculator's catalogue.
//
// This module is intentionally FREE of any Firebase / DOM imports so the dough
// math and the data model can be unit-tested in isolation (see
// tests/calculator-config.test.mjs). The owner cannot read code, so these tests
// are the safety net (P15).
//
// THE MODEL — a product belongs to the client that orders it:
//   • config.clients[] is the address book, and each client carries its own
//     `products[]`: { id, name, recipeId, weight, kind, crate }. There is no shared
//     catalogue: what a client orders is described in one place, on one screen.
//   • A recipe tab is a FILTERED VIEW: getTabProducts(config, recipeId) walks every
//     client's products and emits one row per product belonging to that recipe.
//     Quantities are per (client, product), keyed by `qtyId` = pairId(clientId, id).
//
// Why the shared catalogue was dropped (Aug 2026): it existed so two clients could
// order the SAME product and its weight be changed in one place. In the real data only
// one product out of ten was shared, and the price was two screens and seven steps to
// add a product. Two clients ordering the same thing now hold their own independent
// copy, which is also what the owner asked for: changing one must not move the other.
//
// ⚠️ Two clients migrated from one catalogue product KEEP THE SAME id. Four things key
// by it — divisor ticks, WhatsApp lists, saved log rows, and typed quantities — and
// minting a fresh id would quietly cut all four. Where the client is known, resolve a
// product inside THAT client's list (see resolveListClients).
//
// item.kind drives the INPUT WIDGET in the calculator, NOT the math:
//   'number'   → plain numeric quantity field (default)
//   'dropdown' → quantity picked from a fixed preset dropdown (0/20/40/60/80/100)
//   'kg'       → quantity entered directly in kilograms (weight 1000 g/kg)
// Legacy kinds are migrated on load: 'ciabatta' → 'dropdown', 'panini' → 'number'.
// An association can opt into a "crate box" (item.crate = { show, perBox }): a
// display-only helper showing how many crates its order fills.
//
// WhatsApp orders are INDEPENDENT of the recipe tabs. There are two kinds, both sent
// from the WhatsApp button and edited in the WhatsApp settings screen:
//   • `whatsappLists` — a list has a title and a set of client entries; each entry
//     references an address-book client (by id, for its name) and an explicitly
//     chosen set of catalogue product ids.
//   • `whatsappClients` — a standalone "direct client": a TYPED name plus catalogue
//     product ids. Sent on its own, without a list.
// Product ids are resolved live from the catalogue (a rename propagates; a deleted
// product is pruned). The dough math never reads this — it is purely for the order
// message.

// ── Free lines: things a client buys that the bakery does not calculate ───────
// A line that exists ONLY in the WhatsApp message. It carries its own name and is
// not a product at all, which is the entire point:
//
//   • it can never reach the dough calculation, structurally — not by a flag being
//     respected in every place that counts a product, but because there is nothing
//     to count;
//   • it can never be pruned away, because there is no reference to resolve;
//   • the order form always leaves it at 0, because no production log can ever name
//     it — which is right, since nobody logs what they did not make.
//
// It exists because of a real case: a client buys loaves that are cut from the bread
// baked for ANOTHER client, so the dough is already counted once and must not be
// counted twice — but the line still has to appear in the message, or the client is
// sent an order missing what they asked for. Until now the only way was to borrow
// the other client's product, which worked and was fragile: delete that product
// everywhere and this line vanished from the message in silence.
//
// ⚠️ THE ID IS PREFIXED `wx-`, AND THAT PREFIX IS LOAD-BEARING. The order modal keys
// its inputs by product id and the prefill keys its lookups the same way, so a free
// line must never collide with a real `p-…` id — a collision would put a client's
