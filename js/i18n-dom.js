// The words written straight into the HTML — page headers, the Home cards, the
// titles of the overlays declared in calculator.html.
//
// ⚠️ THE ENGLISH STAYS IN THE MARKUP AND IS NOT REPLACED BY A KEY. Two reasons,
// and both matter more than tidiness:
//
//   1. If this script never runs — a syntax error somewhere else on the page, a
//      module that fails to load — the screen shows English rather than a row of
//      dotted identifiers. The failure degrades to the old behaviour instead of
//      to nonsense.
//   2. The markup stays readable, and a diff of it stays reviewable.
//
// ⚠️ AND IT RUNS BEFORE THE FIRST PAINT, from the <head>, for the same reason
// splash-init.js does: a heading that changes language a moment after the screen
// appears is worse than one that never changes at all.

import { t, currentLanguage, onLanguageChange } from './i18n.js';

// Every element carrying data-i18n gets its text replaced. An element may also
// carry data-i18n-attr="placeholder" (or any attribute name) to have that
// attribute translated instead of the text — a placeholder is read by exactly
// the same person as the label above it.
export function applyStaticText(root = document) {
  // ⚠️ THE PAGE HAS TO SAY WHAT LANGUAGE IT IS IN, and every one of them said `lang="en"`
  // in the markup and never changed it. That attribute is not decoration: a screen reader
  // chooses its pronunciation rules from it, so on an Italian venue every Italian
  // sentence in this app was read out with English pronunciation — which is close to
  // unintelligible, and completely invisible to anybody looking at the screen.
  // Set here rather than in js/i18n.js because this is the file that owns the document.

    // "calc.something" — so a key that resolves to itself is left alone and the

// cards — found by driving the switch and reading what came back.
