// home-orders-badge.js — Orders signals on the Home (landing) screen, so Federico
// is reminded to place an order without opening the Orders page:
//   1. A small count badge on the Orders card whenever an order is due today
//      (persistent, at-a-glance).
//   2. A tappable "Order(s) to place today: …" banner that shows ONCE per day and
//      then stays hidden for the rest of that day (no nagging on every app open),
//      plus the matching browser notification, also once a day.
//
// Best-effort and lightweight: on Home load, the suppliers plus TODAY's orders only
// (a one-day query, never the whole archive — see getHistoryForDay), then the pure
// computeAlerts (reused from the Orders feature) runs over them. Nothing shows
// offline or on any error.
//
// Home is the shared landing screen — the ONE sanctioned place a feature signal
// may surface outside its own folder (see the modularity note in the project docs).
// It reuses the Orders data layer + pure alert engine, so there is no duplicated
// logic to drift out of sync.
