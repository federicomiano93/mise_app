// roles.js — what a person may do inside a location they already belong to.
//
// This is the SECOND question about an account, and it is not the first one.
// js/sections.js answers "which locations may this account open"; that is the
// boundary between two businesses. This file answers "and once inside, may they
// take things away" — a boundary between two people in the SAME business.
//
// It exists because the app is going to be sold. With two venues that both
// belong to Federico, everyone inside a location being able to delete everything
// is a shrug. With a paying customer it is a support call: their counter staff
// empties their supplier list and the phone that rings is ours.
//
// ⚠️ THE ROLE HAS NO FIELD OF ITS OWN — it is the VALUE of the membership entry
// (`locations.<id>`), and accessValue() in js/sections.js is the one place that
// reads it. A separate `roles` map was built first and abandoned: firestore.rules
// could not read a second map without answering with an evaluation error instead
// of a clean refusal. It denied, so the app behaved correctly, but a security
// rule whose failure mode nobody can explain is not one to keep. The full story
// is in the comment on accessValue().
//
// The happy consequence is that membership and role became the SAME fact, so a
// role can no longer disagree with a membership — the earlier shape allowed
// `roles: { someone-elses-place: 'owner' }` and had to defend against it.

import { accessValue, OWNER, MANAGER } from './sections.js';

// THREE roles, and the third one earns its place. Federico's own words for them
// (11 Aug 2026): the proprietario, the head chef or manager, and the ordinary
// employee. That is a real distinction in a kitchen, not a technical one — it
// separates the person who HIRES from the people who WORK — which is why it will
// still make sense when the software has changed.
//
// ⚠️ THREE IS ALSO THE CEILING. The reason is not effort, it is that a
// permission system nobody can hold in their head fails the same way every
// time: it becomes so tiring to work out who may do what that everybody is made
// an owner to get the app working, and then there are no roles at all.
// ⚠️ THE WORDS COME FROM THE DICTIONARY; THE VALUES DO NOT AND MUST NOT. Every
// identifier in this file — 'owner', 'manager', 'staff', 'head-chef' — is stored
// in users/{uid} and read by firestore.rules, so it is DATA. Only the words a
// person reads are looked up. tests/i18n.test.mjs fails if the two are confused.

//
// The two defaults already in this app point in OPPOSITE directions, each for a
// stated reason (js/sections.js): membership defaults to NONE because it is a
// boundary; sections default to ALL ON because a forgotten field must never
// empty an app that is working.
//
// This one is about DESTRUCTIVE POWER, so it follows membership, not sections:
// power that nobody explicitly granted does not exist. It is also what makes the
// change safe to deploy — every membership in production is written `true`, which
// reads as staff, so nobody is locked out on the day the rules land; the accounts
// that should hold owner powers get them from the backfill.

// ── A job title, which is NOT a fourth level of power ────────────────────────

// Federico, 13 Aug 2026: «aggiungi head chef come figura della cucina ma è come

// "the head chef or manager" in his own words from 11 August — the level always
// meant this; only the word was missing.
//
// ⚠️⚠️ SO IT IS A TITLE STORED BESIDE THE ROLE, NOT A NEW MEMBERSHIP VALUE, and
// that distinction is the whole of this feature. A new membership value has to be
// added in THREE separate places — js/sections.js accessValue(), member() in
// firestore.rules, and accessValue() in functions/onboarding.js — and a value any
// one of them does not recognise is not a demotion, it is a LOCKOUT. That was
// missed in all three, on three separate days (v268). A head chef holds
// `'manager'`, so there is nothing for any of them to learn.
//
// ⚠️ AND NO RULE READS IT, exactly like firstName/lastName on the same document,
// which is already documented as "a label, never an identity". Renaming somebody
// must never change what they can do.
