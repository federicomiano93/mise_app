//      this app can let a person make, and it is invisible until the delivery
//      turns up somewhere else.
//   2. Show only the cards that location uses. The rules refuse the rest
//      anyway; this is so nobody taps into a screen that will only ever show
//      permission errors.
//
// Log out sits here too, deliberately quiet next to the location name (P20:
// a destructive action never competes with the thing you actually came to do).
