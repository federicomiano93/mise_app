//
// ⚠️ THIS IS THE ONLY DOOR THIS APP HAS EVER OPENED FROM THE INSIDE. Until now,
// membership was written by hand in the Firebase console and by nothing else,
// which is exactly what made it a boundary between two businesses. That cannot
// survive selling the app: every customer would be half an hour of console, with
// an invisible typo waiting (a trailing space in a field name already cost this
// project half an hour once). So a Cloud Function writes it instead — after
// checking a code that came from somebody who was already allowed to hand it out.
//
// ⚠️ THE APP CANNOT BE TRUSTED WITH THIS AND IS NOT. users/{uid} is still
// `allow write: if false` for every client. The decisions below run on the
// server with the Admin SDK; this file is PURE so those decisions can be tested
// without a database, and so the phone can use the same rules to tell somebody
// their code is malformed before spending a network round trip on it.
//
// ⚠️ functions/join-code.js IS A COPY OF THIS FILE, pinned identical by
// tests/copie-allineate.test.mjs. It cannot be imported across: a functions
// deploy uploads only that folder, so `../js/` resolves on this machine and is
// missing in the cloud. Same reason, same sentinel, as functions/push-model.js.

// Two shapes, because they are handed over in two completely different ways.
//
//   'digits'  six digits, read aloud by an owner to somebody standing next to
//             them. Short because it is TYPED, and kitchen staff often have no
//             email address they actually read on a phone — which is why this is
//             a code at all and not an email invite.
//
//   'link'    a long random token inside a URL, sent to a new customer over
//             WhatsApp or email. Nobody types it, so it can be as long as it
//             likes, and it is the owner's own first way in.
//
// ⚠️ SIX DIGITS IS A MILLION, AND A CALLABLE IS REACHABLE BY ANYONE who knows the
// project id — which is public. Short is only safe because of the limits below,
// and they work together: remove any one and the code becomes guessable.

// this file already contained the argument for that before it was written down.
//
// The table used to read `{ digits: 24h, link: 7d }` and the comment above it
// reasoned in words about PURPOSE — "a staff code", "the owner link" — because
// while every staff invitation was six digits, shape and purpose were the same
// fact wearing two names. They came apart the day a staff invitation could also
// be a link. Keying on the shape would then have handed a staff link the
// customer's seven days, which is the exact thing the old comment warned
// against: "a week would leave a live key in a WhatsApp thread nobody rereads".
//
//   'staff'     hiring somebody into a location that already exists. They are
//               standing in the kitchen, or they start tomorrow. A day is
//               already generous.
//   'customer'  selling the app to a stranger. It travels to somebody who may
//               not be at their desk, and it is the only thing standing between
//               them and their new app.
