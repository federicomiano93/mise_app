// The only code in this project that does not run on a phone.
//
// It exists for one reason: when you leave the app, the phone SUSPENDS the page.
// Nothing runs, so nothing can ring. A notification has to arrive from outside the
// device — which means something has to be awake when the phone is not.
//
// Three pieces, and nothing else:
//   1. a phone asks for an alarm  → schedule the job for that instant
//   2. the job comes due          → ask whether it is still wanted, then send
//   3. a client sends an order    → tell the bakery's phones straight away
//
// ⚠️ push-model.js IS A COPY OF js/push-model.js, AND A TEST PINS THEM IDENTICAL.
// Whether an alarm is still wanted is a JUDGEMENT, and two copies of a judgement
// drift — the phone would think it had cancelled something the server still
// believed in. It cannot simply be imported across: a functions deploy uploads
// only this folder, so a reference to ../js/ would resolve on this machine and be
// missing in the cloud. The project already carries duplicated files for the same
// kind of reason (confirm-dialog.js, dom.js) and already has the sentinel that
// stops them drifting: tests/copie-allineate.test.mjs.
