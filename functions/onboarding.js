// ⚠️ WHY THIS HAS TO BE SERVER CODE, and why the obvious shortcut is forbidden.
// users/{uid} says which locations an account may open, and it is
// `allow write: if false` for every client — that single fact is what makes it a
// boundary between two businesses rather than a preference. Letting the app write
// ANOTHER person's users document, which is the one-line way to make an invite
// button work, would hand every signed-in client a master key to the whole
// database, across every location, for ever. So the write happens here, with the
// Admin SDK, after this file has checked that whoever asked was already entitled
// to hand out what they are handing out.
//
// The four, and who may call each:
//   createWorkspace   the app's owner only   a new customer's location + its first link
//   createJoinCode    a location's owner     one invitation: digits, or a link
//   redeemJoinCode    anybody signed in      THE only write to users/{uid}
//   setMemberRole     a location's owner     promote, demote, remove
//
// ⚠️ EVERY DECISION THAT CAN BE MADE WITHOUT A DATABASE LIVES IN join-code.js,
// which is a byte-for-byte copy of js/join-code.js pinned by a test. The limits
// that make a six-digit code safe are only safe TOGETHER, and a server that
// quietly relaxed one while the app still believed it would not be visible from
// either side.
