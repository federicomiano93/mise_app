// recipe-photo.js — the shell around functions/recipe-photo-model.js: the secret,
// the network, the database. It contains no judgement at all.
//
// ⚠️⚠️ EVERY DECISION IS IN THE MODEL, AND THAT IS FORCED. This file imports
// @anthropic-ai/sdk and firebase-functions, which CI installs only in the
// deploy-functions job — so a root test can never load it, and anything that
// mattered and lived here would be untested for ever. What is left is wiring, and
// the wiring is checked by reading this file (tests/recipe-photo-handler.test.mjs).
//
// ⚠️ THIS IS THE FIRST CODE IN THE PROJECT THAT SPENDS MONEY PER TAP, and the first
// that holds a REAL secret (js/firebase.js is public config; this is not). Four
// guards, in order of how much they can be relied on:
//   1. a SPEND LIMIT on the Anthropic key itself — the only one that holds when
//      this code is wrong, and it is set outside the repo;
//   2. maxInstances below;
//   3. the daily allowances, charged in the model before the reader is called;
//   4. the payload caps.
//
// ⚠️ The key must never reach a browser. That is the whole reason this exists
// rather than the app calling the API itself.

// one real read of an Italian recipe cost 3318 input + 280 output tokens, which is
// about 2.4p on Opus 5 and about 1.4p here. Loading two hundred recipes is the
// difference between roughly £4.80 and £2.80, once.
//
// ⚠️ WHAT IS BEING TRADED IS NOT MONEY, IT IS THE ONE ERROR THIS FEATURE CAN MAKE.
// Nothing downstream can catch a misread quantity: «1,5 kg» read as 15 kg looks
// exactly like a number somebody typed, and it is found at the oven.
//
// ✅ MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED: the same photograph was read by both, and the two answers
// were identical line for line — name, seven rows, «1,5 kg» correctly 1.5 and not 15,
// «1 cucchiaino» as 1 tsp, «q.b.» as 0 "to taste", the method ignored. On PRINTED
// text there is nothing to choose between them.
//

// handwritten recipes start coming back wrong, THIS LINE is the first thing to
// change back.
