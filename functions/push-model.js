// push-model.js — PURE: what gets scheduled, whether it is still worth sending,
// and what the notification actually says.
//
// No DOM, no Firebase, no `Date.now()` read from inside — every function that
// cares about time is handed `nowMs`. It is shared by the APP (which schedules)
// and by the SERVER (which sends), so both sides agree by construction about when
// an alarm is still wanted. A second copy of these decisions on the server would
// be a copy of a JUDGEMENT, and the two would drift into a phone that buzzes for
// something it should not.
//
// ⚠️ IT LIVES IN js/ ROOT, like price-model.js, for the same reason: the guided
// mixing (a catalogue screen), the client orders (a calculator screen) and the
// server all read it, and a feature folder must never import from another one.

// ── Scheduling ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

// Below this there is no point scheduling anything, and the reason is physical
// rather than a preference: enqueueing the job and delivering the push take a few
// seconds between them, so a notification for a 10-second timer would arrive
// AFTER the alarm the app itself already sounded. Nobody leaves the app for ten
// seconds either.

// step (12 hours in guided-model.js), so a corrupt value cannot park a job in the
// queue for a week.
export const MAX_AHEAD_MS = 12 * 60 * 60 * 1000;

// ⚠️ AND A JOB THAT FIRES VERY LATE IS DROPPED, NOT SENT. A queue can retry, a
// phone can be off, a function can be slow — and a "add the butter" buzzing an
// hour after the dough was finished is worse than silence: it is the fastest way
// to make somebody turn notifications off for good. Fifteen minutes is generous
// for a delivery hiccup and far short of a step anybody is still waiting on.
export const MAX_LATE_MS = 15 * 60 * 1000;

// ⚠️ THE SENDER ASKS "IS THIS STILL WANTED?", IT IS NOT CANCELLED.

// The obvious design is to delete the queued job when somebody taps Done. That
// fails quietly in every way a network can: the delete is refused, or arrives
// after the job has already been picked up, and the phone buzzes for a step
// finished ten minutes ago. Re-reading one flag an instant before sending cannot
// fail quietly — if the read fails, nothing is sent, which is the safe direction.
//
// Three ways to be un-wanted, and each is a real case:
//   active === false  — somebody tapped Done, Skip, or left the mix
//   too early         — the queue fired ahead of time (a retry, a clock skew)
//   too late          — see MAX_LATE_MS

// ── The words the SERVER sends ────────────────────────────────────────────────

// into functions/, where `../js/` does not exist (a deploy uploads only that
// folder), so importing it would resolve here and be missing in the cloud. That
// is the same wall join-code.js hits, and the answer is the same: the handful of
// phrases only the server ever produces live with the server code.
//
// It is NOT a duplicate of anything: no screen shows these words. A notification
// is written when nobody is looking at the app, so it is the one text that cannot
// be built by the page that knows the language.
//
// ⚠️ AND IT HAD TO EXIST. Until this release every notification was English in
// both languages — the same defect as the join-code expiry, which read
// "24 hours left" in the middle of an Italian sentence. Adding a THIRD English
// notification to an app that now speaks two languages would have been shipping
// a known defect on purpose.
