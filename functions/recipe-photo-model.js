// recipe-photo-model.js — turning a photograph of a recipe into a DRAFT somebody
// then checks by hand. PURE: no network, no Firestore, no clock read from inside.
//
// Federico, 22 Aug 2026: «per facilitare il caricamento delle ricette vorrei che
// tramite una foto venga creata la ricetta con i campi precompilati, il salvataggio
// finale spetta sempre all'operatore».
//
// ⚠️⚠️ THE WHOLE FILE IS SHAPED BY ONE FACT: A MACHINE READING A PHOTOGRAPH IS
// SOMETIMES CONFIDENTLY WRONG, AND A WRONG QUANTITY LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE A RIGHT ONE.
// 100 g read as 1000 g is not a visible defect — it is a ruined batch found at the
// oven. So nothing here is ever saved: this produces a draft, the existing recipe
// editor shows it, and the person presses Save. Three rules follow from that:
//
//   1. it would rather return NOTHING than something that looks complete and is
//      not. `found` is a field the reader must set, never something inferred from
//      an empty list — see draftFromToolInput;
//   2. every value is clamped to what the database will actually accept, here, in
//      one tested place. A key or a size the rules refuse makes EVERY later save of
//      that recipe fail with a permission error the screen cannot explain;
//   3. it costs real money per call, so the limits are counted before the work and
//      never refunded.
//
// ⚠️ THIS FILE HAS NO IMPORTS, AND THAT IS FORCED, NOT STYLISTIC. CI's `test` job
// runs `node --test` at the repo root and NEVER runs `npm ci` in functions/ — that
// happens only in `deploy-functions`. A file the root tests import must therefore
// resolve with no node_modules. Every judgement lives here; functions/recipe-photo.js
// is a shell that supplies the network and nothing else.

// ── What the database will accept ────────────────────────────────────────────
// ⚠️ THESE MIRROR firestore.rules AND MUST NOT DRIFT. The recipes block reads
// `name.size() < 200` and `ingredients.size() <= 300`, so the cap here is 199, not
// 200. tests/recipe-photo-caps.test.mjs parses those two numbers out of the rules
// file and compares them with these — because drift does not fail here, it fails
// later, as a permission error on somebody else's save.

// The twelve units the catalogue understands. ⚠️ A COPY of CATALOGUE_UNITS in
// js/catalogue/catalogue-model.js, and it cannot be an import: that file imports
// the i18n dictionary, which cannot run on the server. Pinned by
// tests/recipe-photo-model.test.mjs, which reads the other file and compares.

// misread decimal point, and clamping is kinder than refusing the whole recipe.

// ── What one call may carry ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Five photos covers a recipe written across a double page and its overleaf. The
// byte caps keep the callable payload well inside its ~10MB ceiling AND keep the
// bill down: the reader charges by pixels, so a photo nobody downscaled costs more
// and reads no better (it is downsampled at the far end anyway).

// about $24 in a day — a bill nobody chose. Per venue alone, one person could use
// up everybody else's allowance before the morning shift arrives.
//
// ⚠️ AND NEITHER IS THE REAL GUARD. The real guard is the spend limit on the API
// key itself, which holds even if this file is wrong. These two exist so a mistake
// costs pennies rather than the whole month's cap.
