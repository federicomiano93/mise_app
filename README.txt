# The Italian Club — PWA

A mobile-first Progressive Web App for hospitality venues, with four sections:

- **Calculator** — dough scaling from production orders (Focaccia, Brioche, Sourdough).
- **Recipe catalogue** — a searchable recipe library, scalable to a total weight.
- **Orders** — supplier-order workflow: suppliers & ingredients, stock-based
  order suggestions learned from history, autosaving real-time draft, preview and
  WhatsApp send, order history, and a management panel.
- **Pastries** — what to put to prove, one list per weekday. Opens on the day being
  proved FOR, with the work day rolling over at 4am so a night shift is one day.
  A quantity can be corrected straight from the list; each day carries a standing
  note; and Accept keeps the night as a record, shown for 15 days.

It serves **several venues from one deployment**. Each signs in with its own account
and sees only its own data, and each is set up with only the sections it uses.

## Firebase config
`js/firebase.js` is **committed to Git**: Firebase web API keys are public config
(sent to every visitor's browser), not secrets. Security comes from Firestore
Security Rules + API key restrictions, never from hiding the file.
`js/firebase.example.js` is the matching template (placeholder values + docs for
the Orders collections and the future FCM setup). Keep it in sync with firebase.js.

Real secrets (service-account JSON, `.env`) are never committed.

## Local testing
Service workers and Firebase need a server (not file://):
```
npx http-server . -p 8765
```
then open http://localhost:8765/

## Deploy
Hosted on GitHub Pages — every push to `main` goes live automatically.
After editing any cached file, bump `CACHE_NAME = 'theitalianclub-vNN'` in sw.js
so users receive the update. Deploy Firestore rules separately when they change:
```
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

## Versioning
Releases are tracked with git tags (semver `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`), never by renaming
the repo. First release: v1.0.0.

## Install on a device
Open the install guide and follow the steps for your device:
https://federicomiano93.github.io/mise_app/install-guide.html
- iPhone/iPad: Safari → Share → "Add to Home Screen".
- Android: Chrome → "Install app" / menu → "Add to Home screen".
- Computer: Chrome/Edge → install icon in the address bar.
(Installs once per device; after that it opens like any app. Browsers do not allow
automatic install — a one-time user action is always required.)

## Works offline
The service worker precaches the app and serves a cached copy instantly, updating
in the background. Fonts are self-hosted. The Firebase SDK modules are kept in a
SEPARATE persistent cache so they survive the per-deploy cache bump and the app can
boot offline; the live Firestore/Auth API and gov.uk are never cached.

## Data model (Firestore)
Every document a venue owns lives under its own folder, so one venue's data cannot
be reached from another's path at all. `js/location.js` is the only file that turns
a collection name into a path.

`locations/{id}` — the venue itself: its display name and which sections it uses.
Written only from the Firebase console.

`locations/{id}/…`
- `suppliers/{id}` — name, category, deliveryDays, orderDays, phone, email, active.
- `ingredients/{id}` — name, supplierId, brand, weight, category, unit, active.
- `drafts/current` — the order in progress (autosaved, real-time), plus the day each
  supplier's rows were typed on.
- `orders-history/{YYYY-MM-DD}_{supplierId}` — one record per DAY per SUPPLIER
  (ordered quantities + stock on hand). Records from the earlier weekly model
  (`orders-history/{weekId}`) are still read; nothing was migrated.
- `recipes/{id}` — the recipe catalogue, one document per recipe.
- `pastries/{Weekday}` — what to put to prove, one document per weekday and never
  more than seven (id = 'Monday'…'Sunday', the same vocabulary as orderDays).
  Carries the day's standing `note`.
- `pastry-logs/{YYYY-MM-DD}_{Weekday}` — a night kept as a record: the work DATE it
  was proved on and WHICH list it was. Accepting twice in one night replaces.
  ⚠️ NOTHING HERE IS EVER DELETED AUTOMATICALLY. A record leaves the SCREEN after
  15 days and stays in the database for good — the same shape as the Calculator
  log ("DISPLAY-only") and the Orders history ("This HIDES, it never deletes").
  Only the bin on the Records screen removes one, and a person has to tap it.
  Because the collection grows for ever, the READ is bounded instead: newest 120
  by `date` (never by document id — Firestore refuses a descending key scan).
- `logs/{id}`, `log/{dough}` — production logs. (`daily-logs/{YYYY-MM-DD}` still holds
  the documents written before Aug 2026; nothing writes or reads it any more.)
- `config/calculator`, `config/orders` — settings, mirrored to localStorage.

Every document also carries its venue id in a `bakery` field, which the rules require
to match the folder it sits in — the field and the path can never disagree. (The
field name is historical.)

`users/{uid}` — which venues an account may open: `{ locations: { <id>: true } }`.
Readable only by that account and writable by **no client**: the Firebase console is
the only way in, so nobody can grant themselves access.

## Security
- **Firestore rules** (firestore.rules) enforced server-side: membership required per
  venue, payloads validated, deletes restricted, default-deny for unmatched
  collections.
- **Email/password sign-in.** Accounts are created by the owner in the Firebase
  console; there is no self-registration, and anonymous access is switched off.
  An account with no `users/{uid}` document sees nothing at all.
- **Content Security Policy** on every page restricts what the browser may load
  (scripts/connections/styles/fonts allow-listed).
- **XSS-safe rendering** — Firestore data is rendered via textContent/createElement,
  never innerHTML.

## Notifications
Order alerts (order due, bank holiday next week, delivery-day conflict) are
client-side: in-app banners + browser notifications while the app is open. Push to
staff with the app closed needs a server step (Firebase Cloud Functions) — deferred;
see the FCM notes in js/firebase.example.js.
