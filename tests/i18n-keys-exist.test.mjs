// Every phrase the app ASKS for must be a phrase the dictionary HOLDS.
//
// ⚠️⚠️ THIS IS THE CHECK THAT WAS MISSING, AND IT HAS COST THIS PROJECT THREE
// TIMES IN THREE DAYS. The class is always the same and always silent:
//
//   • 16 replacements were lost when a `git checkout --` during mutation testing
//     took uncommitted work with it. Invisible, because the ENGLISH was
//     unchanged — the screens still read correctly in English and only Italian
//     was missing, which nobody was looking at.
//   • The New customer screen printed «section.calculator» in both languages: the
//     keys were correct and nothing looked them up.
//   • Three spacing tokens were used by twenty CSS declarations and defined
//     nowhere, so the browser dropped all twenty in silence.
//
// A missing key does not throw. translate() returns the key itself, deliberately
// and correctly — a screen showing «people.title» is louder than a blank one. But
// nothing was ASKING, so the loudness only reached whoever happened to open the
// screen, and for the admin screens that was nobody for a day.
//
// ⚠️ IT CHECKS THE ENGLISH DICTIONARY ONLY, on purpose. English is the fallback,
// so a key absent from Italian still shows a real phrase (tests/i18n.test.mjs
// pins that, and separately pins that the two dictionaries match). A key absent
// from English shows nothing but itself, in every language.
