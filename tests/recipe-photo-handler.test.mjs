// The SEQUENCE: who may call the photo reader, what it charges, and in what order.
//
// ⚠️⚠️ THE ORDER IS THE THING BEING TESTED, not the arithmetic — that is proved in
// tests/recipe-photo-model.test.mjs. Three orderings matter, and each has a way of
// being wrong that reads perfectly well:
//   · the payload is checked BEFORE anything is charged;
//   · the allowance is charged BEFORE the reader is called;
//   · and it is NOT given back when the reader throws.
//
// ⚠️ It tests functions/recipe-photo-model.js, never functions/recipe-photo.js. The
// shell imports @anthropic-ai/sdk and firebase-functions, which CI installs only in
// the deploy job — a test that imported it would fail in CI and pass here, which is
// the worst of both. That is exactly why the sequence was put in the model: what
// cannot be loaded cannot be tested, and what cannot be tested rots.
