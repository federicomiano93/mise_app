// firestore-rules-check.mjs — prove the Orders security rules accept every write
// the app really makes, and reject everything else.
//
// Run it, emulator and all, with:
//   npm run test:rules:emulated
// or, against an emulator you already have running under the same project id:
//   npm run test:rules
//
// It also runs in CI on every push — see .github/workflows/test.yml.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The four Orders collections used to validate nothing but
// `bakery == 'main'`. Tightening them is dangerous in one specific way: suppliers,
// ingredients and drafts are written with setDoc(merge: true), and on an update
// Firestore evaluates rules against the FULL MERGED document. So a retired field
// still sitting on a live document — and production really does carry
// notifyHoursBefore and weekId — makes keys().hasOnly() reject every future write
// to it. The failure is silent at the database level and permanent. These tests
// pin exactly that: the legacy shapes must stay writable.
//
// HOW IT WORKS, and why there are no dependencies:
//   * Seeding uses `Authorization: Bearer owner`, which the emulator treats as
//     admin — rules are skipped. That is the only way to plant a legacy shape the
//     new rules would themselves refuse.
//   * Assertions use a real anonymous ID token minted from the Auth emulator, so
//     rules ARE enforced, exactly as in the browser.
//   * Everything is hardcoded to 127.0.0.1. It can never reach production.
//
// FIDELITY NOTE. setDoc(merge:true) is reproduced as PATCH + updateMask listing the
// payload's TOP-LEVEL keys. The SDK deep-merges nested maps where a top-level mask
// replaces them wholesale — immaterial here, because rules only ever see the
// post-write document, and the property under test ("fields outside the mask
// survive, so hasOnly sees them") is reproduced exactly.
//
// Deliberately NOT named *.test.mjs: `node --test` auto-discovers that pattern, and
// the `test` job has no emulator. This suite has its own CI job, which does — see
// .github/workflows/test.yml. Keep the naming as it is.
