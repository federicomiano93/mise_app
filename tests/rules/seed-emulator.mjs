// seed-emulator.mjs — plant production-SHAPED Orders data into the local Firestore
// emulator, so the app can be driven by hand against realistic documents.
//
// Run it with the emulators up, under the SAME project id (see PROJECT below):
//   firebase emulators:start --only auth,firestore --project demo-theitalianclub
//   node tests/rules/seed-emulator.mjs
//
// WHY THE LEGACY SHAPES MATTER. Production carries fields no current code writes,
// because a setDoc(merge:true) write never deletes a field:
//   - suppliers.notifyHoursBefore  — retired 6 Jul 2026 (commit 4fc3658). The same
//     commit ADDED orderDays, so a supplier untouched since has the old field and
//     lacks the new one.
//   - ingredients without brand/weight — both added in v1.10.0 (18 Jul 2026).
//   - drafts/current.weekId — written by the pre-v179 weekly model. The clearDraft()
//     that deleted the document is gone, and clearFields only touches
//     entries.*/days.*, so nothing has ever removed it.
//   - orders-history/2026-W28 — the retired weekly record: weekStart instead of
//     date, every supplier merged, no supplierId/supplierName/updatedAt.
// Seeding only the modern shapes would prove nothing about the documents that
// actually exist.
//
// Writes go in as the emulator OWNER (Authorization: Bearer owner), which bypasses
// security rules — that is the only way to plant shapes the rules themselves reject.
// It never touches production: everything here is hardcoded to 127.0.0.1.
//
// This file is deliberately NOT named *.test.mjs: `node --test` auto-discovers that
// pattern, and this needs a running emulator, which the `test` CI job does not have.
// (The `rules` job does — it starts one around npm run test:rules.)

import { pathToFileURL } from 'node:url';

// The project id is a NAMESPACE inside the emulator, not a destination: every URL
// below points at 127.0.0.1 and nothing here can reach Google. It defaults to a
// `demo-` id because firebase-tools treats that prefix as offline-only — it will
// not look for credentials and cannot be pointed at a real project by accident,
// which is what makes it the right default for CI. Override with
// FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID when the emulator is already running under another id.
//
// It should MATCH the id the emulator was started with — `npm run test:rules:emulated`
// starts both halves together, which is why that script exists. A mismatch is not
// dangerous, though, and no guard was added for it: measured on firebase-tools
// 15.26.0, the emulator applies the loaded ruleset to whatever project id a request
// names, with `singleProjectMode` both true and false (161/161 either way). The only
// consequence of a mismatch is that seeded data and the checks can end up in two
// namespaces, which the suite would report as ordinary failures.
