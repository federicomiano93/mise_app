// The English the app speaks, checked as a whole.
//
// Federico asked for a grammar pass over the app (13 Aug 2026) before the ~250
// user-facing sentences are lifted into a translation dictionary — because a
// sentence corrected AFTER extraction has to be corrected twice, in the key and
// in every translation.
//
// ⚠️ THIS FILE FIXES THE CLASS, NOT THE OCCURRENCES. Nineteen strings were wrong
// on the day it was written; correcting only those leaves the next one to be
// written wrong, and punctuation is invisible in review. What is pinned here is
// the RULE.
//
// 📌 What the pass found, and did NOT find: the app is consistent British English
// with no American spellings, no `...` where `…` belongs, and no double spaces.
// The two real classes were both punctuation, and both had the same cause — see
// below.

// ⚠️ THE RULES APPLY TO STRINGS, NOT TO LINES, and the difference is what makes
// this test usable. A first version tested whole lines and reported nineteen
// hits, twelve of which were a developer's trailing comment — «// the client's
// detail» — which no baker will ever read. A test that cries wolf twelve times
// out of nineteen is a test somebody switches off.
//
// Extracting the string literals also handles the comment case for free: a
// comment contains no string literal, so it simply has nothing to check.
// ⚠️ AND IT HAS TO STOP AT A COMMENT, which a regex over the line cannot do. The
// second version extracted string literals and still reported fourteen hits —
// every one of them a phrase QUOTED INSIDE a comment («// Per-recipe "show this
// recipe's logs" flags»). Explaining the app in prose is exactly where an
// apostrophe belongs; the rule is about what reaches a screen.
//
// So this walks the line once, yields the text inside each string literal, and
// stops dead at // or /*. Small enough to read, and exact where a regex guesses.

// ⚠️ THE CONSOLE IS THE DEVELOPER'S CHANNEL, NEVER A SCREEN. `console.warn('Could
// not watch tonight's confirmations:')` is a sentence written for whoever is

// nobody reads at the cost of the signal here meaning something.

// reported as an American spelling, because `organiz` is inside `organizza`. Italian

// somebody reads when something has already gone wrong were the scruffy ones.
//
// 📌 THE CAUSE WAS TECHNICAL, NOT CARELESSNESS, which is exactly why a test is
// the right answer: inside single quotes an apostrophe must be escaped, so
// whoever wrote those reached for `’`; inside a backtick template it needs no
// escaping, so they typed `'` and it read fine to them.

  // by one.
  //
