// Removing a business that was created by mistake.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS. Federico opened Mise on his phone, added his own bakery from the
// customer list, and was left with a business he could not enter and could not
// remove: the app could create and never undo, so the Firebase console was the
// only way out — the exact thing this area of the app exists to stop needing.
//
// ⚠️⚠️ AND WHY IT IS DANGEROUS. This is the only function in the project that
// destroys a whole location. Past the moment somebody has opened it, that location
// is a real customer's — their recipes, their suppliers, their staff, their prices
// — and none of it comes back. Everything below is about that one constraint.
//
// ⚠️ THESE ARE SOURCE CHECKS, like tests/create-own-business.test.mjs beside them.
// functions/onboarding.js runs in Cloud Functions against the Admin SDK; `node
// --test` can neither call it nor fake Firestore convincingly. What can be pinned
// is the SHAPE, and the shape is where the danger is. The behaviour is proved by
// driving the app against the emulator — including the case the screen cannot
// reach, which is a business somebody HAS opened.
