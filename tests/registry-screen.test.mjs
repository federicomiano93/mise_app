// the fourteen allergens are declared, and it is the one screen in this app that
// can send somebody to hospital. Two things must stay true, and neither is visible
// by using the app:
//
//   1. NO NEW SECTION NAME. `suppliers` must never appear in js/sections.js
//      SECTIONS. A name added there defaults to ALLOWED for every location
//      document written before today — so inventing one would silently switch a
//      screen on for every existing venue AND let them write its collections.
//   2. NO ROLE GATE ON THE WAY IN. The records were open to everybody in the
//      location when they lived behind the gear, deliberately. v1.62.0 cost this
//      project exactly once already: a bar gated for one reason walled off
//      everything later put inside it.
