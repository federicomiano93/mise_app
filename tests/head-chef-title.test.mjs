// «Head chef» — a job title, and the server half that keeps it honest.
//
// Federico, 13 Aug 2026: «aggiungi head chef come figura della cucina ma è come
// il ruolo del manager». js/roles.js is covered by tests/roles.test.mjs; this
// file covers the half that runs in Cloud Functions, which `node --test` can
// neither call nor fake convincingly — so it pins the SHAPE, and the shape is
// where the danger is.
//
// ⚠️ THIS FILE EXISTS BECAUSE A MUTATION CAME BACK GREEN. Breaking the server's
// title-clearing left all 1192 tests passing: the guard had nothing watching it.
// A green run after a real mutation means the guard is untested, and the answer
// is a test, never a shrug.

// ── It is a title, not a membership value ───────────────────────────────────

// ⚠️ THE ONE TO KEEP IF EVERY OTHER TEST HERE WERE DELETED. A new membership
// value must be added in THREE separate places — js/sections.js accessValue(),
// member() in firestore.rules, and accessValue() in functions/onboarding.js —
// and a value any one of them does not know is a LOCKOUT, not a demotion. That
// was missed in all three, on three separate days (v268). 'head-chef' is a word
// on the roster and must never reach a membership.

// ── The title is cleared when the level loses it ────────────────────────────

// ⚠️ THE MUTATION THAT CAME BACK GREEN. A title left behind on somebody demoted
// to employee has the roster calling them "Head chef" while the database says
// they may delete nothing — and that screen is the only place anybody looks.
// These documents are merge-written, so "leave it out" means "keep what was

// re-reads a screen they filled in yesterday.

// is a feature that does not exist, and every test stays green while it does not.

//
// ⚠️ THE SENTENCE MOVED INTO THE DICTIONARY, THE RULE DID NOT — and the test got
// stronger following it, because a translation is exactly where this protection
// would be lost. A translator handed «The same as Manager…» in a list of phrases
// has no way of knowing that softening it changes who can delete a supplier. So
