// The interface language must never reach a label.
//
// ⚠️⚠️ THIS IS THE ONE THAT PROTECTS SOMEBODY, and it is worth stating plainly why
// a whole test file exists for a rule that could have been a comment.
//
// An allergen label is a legal document. Retained Reg. (EU) 1169/2011 requires it
// to be in a language understood where the food is SOLD — so the words on it are
// decided by the venue's country (js/market.js) and by nothing else. The
// interface language is a preference: what the staff read on screen.
//
// Federico's own venues are the case that makes this real. They are in England
// and he is Italian: he wants the app in Italian and his labels MUST stay in
// English. The moment somebody wires t() into the label code, setting the
// interface to Italian starts printing Italian allergen labels for food sold in
// the United Kingdom — and it would look like the feature working.
//
// ⚠️ A COMMENT SAYING "DO NOT DO THIS" IS NOT A GUARD. This is the technique from
// v1.24.1: a rule that matters more than a behaviour gets pinned by a test that
// NAMES it when broken, because a rule that lives only in a comment comes back.

  // exactly the mixture label-view.js is allowed and everything else is not. Like
