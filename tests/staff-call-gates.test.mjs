//
// ⚠️ THE DEFECT THIS PINS, found by driving the app on 12 Aug 2026. The three
// calls that belong to the app's OWN back office are made from the Misé home
// screen, which sits ABOVE every location. They awaited `sessionReady`, which
// resolves when a location OPENS — and on that screen none ever does. The
// Businesses list sat on "Loading…" indefinitely: no error, nothing in the
// console, nothing on screen. Every check about the panel passed, because the
// panel was fine.
//
// The two halves are each defensible on their own, which is what makes it the
// same shape as the sale that had no door (v1.39.0): a promise that means "a
// location is open", and a screen that has no location. Nothing links them
// except this test.
//
// ⚠️ AND THE OPPOSITE SWAP IS ALSO A DEFECT, so both directions are pinned. The
// venue calls read currentSession().locationId; on signedInReady they could fire
// with no location open and send `undefined` as the place to write to.
