// The sentinel over the files that exist in more than one copy.
//
// The project rule "a feature folder never imports from another feature's folder"
// (CLAUDE.md, "Modular by feature") is deliberate: it keeps each feature liftable
// into its own app. The price is duplicated files, and until now nothing noticed
// when one copy drifted — a fix to confirm-dialog.js applied to three folders out
// of four passed CI without a word. That is what this file exists to stop.
//
// Two things are pinned:
//   1. every confirm-dialog.js copy is the same file, full stop;
//   2. the dom.js copies are ALREADY different, on purpose, so their current
//      difference is photographed and only a NEW difference fails.
//
// ⚠️ HOW MANY COPIES THERE ARE IS NEVER TYPED INTO A SENTENCE. It was, in six
// places, and by the time a seventh folder arrived those sentences said four,
// five and six — three different numbers for the same two lists, in the file
// whose whole job is noticing when copies disagree. Every count below is read
// from the list itself.
//
// ⚠️ Line endings are normalised to LF before anything is compared. This repo is
// edited on Windows with core.autocrlf=true, so the working tree holds CRLF while
// GitHub's Linux runner checks the same commit out with LF. Comparing raw bytes
// would make these tests pass on one machine and fail on the other — a false
// alarm that teaches people to ignore the sentinel, which is worse than no
// sentinel at all.

// they have parted. This test is the only thing that can.
