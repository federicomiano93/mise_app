// Every module in the app must actually parse.
//
// ⚠️⚠️ THIS EXISTS BECAUSE 1247 TESTS STAYED GREEN WHILE A SCREEN WAS BROKEN.
// The extraction pass of 13 Aug 2026 added `import { t } from '../i18n.js'` to
// js/pastries/pastries-day.js twice, which is a SyntaxError — the module never
// loaded and the Pastries day was simply not drawn.
//
// Nothing caught it: no unit test imports that file (it is DOM code), the page
// still rendered its header, and a browser reports the failure only in the
// console. It was found by driving the app and READING what the console said —
// which is not something that happens on every push.
//
// A parse is cheap and it is the floor under everything else: a file that cannot
// be read cannot be wrong in any interesting way, because it never runs at all.
//
// ⚠️ IT IMPORTS RATHER THAN PARSING BY HAND. A hand-written check for "the same
// import twice" would have caught this one case and nothing else; the engine
// catches every syntax error there is, including the next one nobody predicted.
